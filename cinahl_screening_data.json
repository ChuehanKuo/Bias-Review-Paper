      "abstract": "Measurement errors of medico-technical devices can be separated into systematic bias and random error. We propose a new method to address both simultaneously via generalized additive models for location, scale and shape (GAMLSS) in combination with permutation tests. More precisely, we extend a recently proposed boosting algorithm for GAMLSS to provide a test procedure to analyse potential device effects on the measurements. We carried out a large-scale simulation study to provide empirical evidence that our method is able to identify possible sources of systematic bias as well as random error under different conditions. Finally, we apply our approach to compare measurements of skin pigmentation from two different devices in an epidemiological study.",

      "title": "Development and Validation of the US Diabetes, Obesity, Cardiovascular Disease Microsimulation (DOC-M) Model: Health Disparity and Economic Impact Model",
      "abstract": "Background Few simulation models have incorporated the interplay of diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular disease (CVD); their upstream lifestyle and biological risk factors; and their downstream effects on health disparities and economic consequences. Methods We developed and validated a US Diabetes, Obesity, Cardiovascular Disease Microsimulation (DOC-M) model that incorporates demographic, clinical, and lifestyle risk factors to jointly predict overall and racial-ethnic groups-specific obesity, diabetes, CVD, and cause-specific mortality for the US adult population aged 40 to 79 y at baseline. An individualized health care cost prediction model was further developed and integrated. This model incorporates nationally representative data on baseline demographics, lifestyle, health, and cause-specific mortality; dynamic changes in modifiable risk factors over time; and parameter uncertainty using probabilistic distributions. Validation analyses included assessment of 1) population-level risk calibration and 2) individual-level risk discrimination. To illustrate the application of the DOC-M model, we evaluated the long-term cost-effectiveness of a national produce prescription program. Results Comparing the 15-y model-predicted population risk of primary outcomes among the 2001\u20132002 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) cohort with the observed prevalence from age-matched cross-sectional 2003\u20132016 NHANES cohorts, calibration performance was strong based on observed-to-expected ratio and calibration plot analysis. In most cases, Brier scores fell below 0.0004, indicating a low overall prediction error. Using the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis cohorts, the c-statistics for assessing individual-level risk discrimination were 0.85 to 0.88 for diabetes, 0.93 to 0.95 for obesity, 0.74 to 0.76 for CVD history, and 0.78 to 0.81 for all-cause mortality, both overall and in three racial-ethnic groups. Open-source code for the model was posted at https://github.com/food-price/DOC-M-Model-Development-and-Validation . Conclusions The validated DOC-M model can be used to examine health, equity, and the economic impact of health policies and interventions on behavioral and clinical risk factors for obesity, diabetes, and CVD. Highlights We developed a novel microsimula\u2019tion model for obesity, diabetes, and CVD, which intersect together and \u2013 critically for prevention and treatment interventions \u2013 share common lifestyle, biologic, and demographic risk factors. Validation analyses, including assessment of (1) population-level risk calibration and (2) individual-level risk discrimination, showed strong performance across the overall population and three major racial-ethnic groups for 6 outcomes (obesity, diabetes, CVD, and all-cause mortality, CVD- and DM-cause mortality) This paper provides a thorough explanation and documentation of the development and validation process of a novel microsimulation model, along with the open-source code (https://github.com/food-price/ DOCM_validation) for public use, to serve as a guide for future simulation model assessments, validation, and implementation.",

      "abstract": "A major amount of our time working in clinical practice involves thinking and decision making. Perhaps it is because decision making is such a commonplace activity that it is assumed we can all make effective decisions. However, this is not the case and the example of diagnostic error supports this assertion. Until quite recently there has been a general nihilism about the ability to change the way that we think, but it is now becoming accepted that if we can think about, and understand, our thinking processes we can improve our decision making, including diagnosis. In this paper we review the dual process model of decision making and highlight ways in which decision making can be improved through the application of this model to our day-to-day practice and by the adoption of de-biasing strategies and critical thinking.",

      "title": "Re-focusing explainability in medicine",
      "abstract": "Using artificial intelligence to improve patient care is a cutting-edge methodology, but its implementation in clinical routine has been limited due to significant concerns about understanding its behavior. One major barrier is the explainability dilemma and how much explanation is required to use artificial intelligence safely in healthcare. A key issue is the lack of consensus on the definition of explainability by experts, regulators, and healthcare professionals, resulting in a wide variety of terminology and expectations. This paper aims to fill the gap by defining minimal explainability standards to serve the views and needs of essential stakeholders in healthcare. In that sense, we propose to define minimal explainability criteria that can support doctors\u2019 understanding, meet patients\u2019 needs, and fulfill legal requirements. Therefore, explainability need not to be exhaustive but sufficient for doctors and patients to comprehend the artificial intelligence models\u2019 clinical implications and be integrated safely into clinical practice. Thus, minimally acceptable standards for explainability are context-dependent and should respond to the specific need and potential risks of each clinical scenario for a responsible and ethical implementation of artificial intelligence.",

      "title": "Cancer drug development: The missing links",
      "abstract": "Although better science and technology has been linked with better health care, however, reality is much different. Although America and most of Europe are equipped with most advanced science and technology, paradoxically cancer incidence is highest in the world. This indicates that science and technology alone is not sufficient in treating diseases like cancer. It is also now well recognized that more than 95% of the drugs/compounds that kill either cancer cells in culture or regress the tumors in animals, fail in phase I clinical trials in humans, indicating that most pre-clinical models of cancer are inadequate. In addition, most of the anticancer drugs that are approved by the regulatory agencies such as FDA either has no effect on the overall survival of the cancer patient or may provide an increase in few months in overall survival. This is despite the fact that most targeted therapies that are currently available are highly expensive; thus suggesting the lack of affordability. This review is meant to focus on some of these problems in detail and then provide potential solutions since most cancers are caused by multiple genes, and thus multi-targeted therapies are needed such as natural products which are inexpensive, safe and have been used for thousands of years for both prevention and treatment of cancer. Impact statement The success rate for cancer drugs which enter into phase 1 clinical trials is utterly less. Why the vast majority of drugs fail is not understood but suggests that pre-clinical studies are not adequate for human diseases. In 1975, as per the Tufts Center for the Study of Drug Development, pharmaceutical industries expended 100 million dollars for research and development of the average FDA approved drug. By 2005, this figure had more than quadrupled, to $1.3 billion. In order to recover their high and risky investment cost, pharmaceutical companies charge more for their products. However, there exists no correlation between drug development cost and actual sale of the drug. This high drug development cost could be due to the reason that all patients might not respond to the drug. Hence, a given drug has to be tested in large number of patients to show drug benefits and obtain significant results.",

Applying a health equity lens to digital health innovations can help inform the equitable design and development of digital health tools. Specifically, areas of health equity impact that can be targeted in the development of a digital health technology include: the tool itself, including its design, technical development, integration into the healthcare environment, and evaluation; the technology's relationship to various end-users, including individuals, tech proprietors and developers, and the larger healthcare system; and its impact on identified health and social determinant outcomes. Targeting one or more of these areas can help support the design, development, and deployment of digital health tools that actively work to reduce health disparities and promote health equity for socially disadvantaged patient populations. More research is needed to understand the full effect of digital health technology on health disparities, and to develop best practices for equity-centered digital health implementation and evaluation.",

Sub-optimal management of osteoporosis is an area suitable for digital health interventions. While fracture liaison services (FLSs) are proven to greatly improve care for people with osteoporosis, such services might benefit from technologies that enhance automation. The term \u2018Digital Health\u2019 covers a variety of different tools including clinical decision support systems, electronic medical record tools, patient decision aids, patient apps, education tools, and novel artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms. Within the scope of this review are AI solutions that use algorithms within health system registries to target interventions. Clinician-targeted, patient-targeted, or system-targeted digital health interventions could be used to improve management and prevent fragility fractures. This review was commissioned by The Royal Osteoporosis Society and Bone Research Academy during the production of the 2020 Research Roadmap ( https://theros.org.uk ), with the intention of identifying gaps where targeted research funding could lead to improved patient health. We explore potential uses of digital technology in the general management of osteoporosis. Evidence suggests that digital technologies can support multidisciplinary teams to provide the best possible patient care based on current evidence and to support patients in self-management. However, robust randomised controlled studies are still needed to assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of these technologies.",

      "abstract": "Study Design: Narrative review with commentary. Objective: Present healthcare reform focuses on cost-optimization and quality improvement. Spine surgery has garnered particular attention; owing to its costly nature. Ambulatory Surgical Centers (ASC) present a potential avenue for expenditure reduction. While the economic advantage of ASCs is being defined, cost saving should not come at the expense of quality or safety. Methods: This narrative review focuses on current definitions, regulations, and recent medical literature pertinent to spinal surgery in the ASC setting. Results: The past decade witnessed a substantial rise in the proportion of certain spinal surgeries performed at ASCs. This setting is attractive from the payer perspective as remuneration rates are generally less than for equivalent hospital-based procedures. Opportunity for physician ownership and increased surgeon productivity afforded by more specialized centers make ASCs attractive from the provider perspective as well. These factors serve as extrinsic motivators which may optimize and improve quality of surgical care. Much data supports the safety of spine surgery in the ASC setting. However, health care providers and policy makers must recognize that current regulations regarding safety and quality are less than comprehensive and the data is predominately from selected case-series or comparative cohorts with inherent biases, along with ambiguities in the definition of \u201coutpatient.\u201d Conclusions: ASCs hold promise for providing safe and efficient surgical management of spinal conditions; however, as more procedures shift from the hospital to the ASC rigorous quality and safety data collection is needed to define patient appropriateness and track variability in quality-related outcomes.",

This paper aims to provide a practical checklist for market researchers to plan, implement, and report research where vulnerable consumers are the target population. A vulnerable consumer is someone who, due to their circumstances, may be disadvantaged or at risk in some marketplace situations. Here, it is proposed that research conducted about vulnerable consumers must include consumer co-researchers as partners in the research process. The involvement of consumers as co-researchers addresses this methodological gap to some extent by democratizing research design and empowering vulnerable consumers. The CPR Checklist is based on an integrative realistic review method, content validation via an expert panel, and includes consumer co-researcher involvement in the research process. Considering the complexities of vulnerable consumers and market research, the CPR Checklist provides a suite of 'how and why' questions to guide rigorous and ethical project conduct.",

Earlier and greater accrual of long-term conditions (LTCs) may be influenced by the timing and nature of exposure to key risk factors, wider determinants or other LTCs at different life stages. We have established a research collaboration titled \u2018MELD-B\u2019 to understand how wider determinants, sentinel conditions (the first LTC in the lifecourse) and LTC accrual sequence affect risk of early-onset, burdensome MLTC-M, and to inform prevention interventions. Aim Our aim is to identify critical periods in the lifecourse for prevention of early-onset, burdensome MLTC-M, identified through the analysis of birth cohorts and electronic health records, including artificial intelligence (AI)-enhanced analyses. Design We will develop deeper understanding of \u2018burdensomeness\u2019 and \u2018complexity\u2019 through a qualitative evidence synthesis and a consensus study. Using safe data environments for analyses across large, representative routine healthcare datasets and birth cohorts, we will apply AI methods to identify early-onset, burdensome MLTC-M clusters and sentinel conditions, develop semi-supervised learning to match individuals across datasets, identify determinants of burdensome clusters, and model trajectories of LTC and burden accrual. We will characterise early-life (under 18 years) risk factors for early-onset, burdensome MLTC-M and sentinel conditions. Finally, using AI and causal inference modelling, we will model potential \u2018preventable moments\u2019, defined as time periods in the life course where there is an opportunity for intervention on risk factors and early determinants to prevent the development of MLTC-M.

      "abstract": "Objective Assessing pain in individuals with neurological conditions like cerebral palsy is challenging due to limited self-reporting and expression abilities. Current methods lack sensitivity and specificity, underlining the need for a reliable evaluation protocol. An automated facial recognition system could revolutionize pain assessment for such patients. The research focuses on two primary goals: developing a dataset of facial pain expressions for individuals with cerebral palsy and creating a deep learning-based automated system for pain assessment tailored to this group. Methods The study trained ten neural networks using three pain image databases and a newly curated CP-PAIN Dataset of 109 images from cerebral palsy patients, classified by experts using the Facial Action Coding System. Results The InceptionV3 model demonstrated promising results, achieving 62.67% accuracy and a 61.12% F1 score on the CP-PAIN dataset. Explainable AI techniques confirmed the consistency of crucial features for pain identification across models. Conclusion The study underscores the potential of deep learning in developing reliable pain detection systems using facial recognition for individuals with communication impairments due to neurological conditions. A more extensive and diverse dataset could further enhance the models\u2019 sensitivity to subtle pain expressions in cerebral palsy patients and possibly extend to other complex neurological disorders.

Methods The Cox proportional hazards model and five other methods of estimating treatment effects from time-to-event outcomes, which relax the proportional hazards assumption, were applied to a network of melanoma trials reporting overall survival: restricted mean survival time, generalised gamma, piecewise exponential, fractional polynomial and Royston-Parmar models. Results All models fitted the melanoma network acceptably well. However, there were important differences in extrapolations of the survival curve and interpretability of the modelling constraints demonstrating the potential for different conclusions from different modelling approaches. Conclusion The restricted mean survival time, generalised gamma, piecewise exponential, fractional polynomial and Royston-Parmar models can accommodate non-proportional hazards and differing lengths of trial follow-up within a network meta-analysis of time-to-event outcomes. We recommend that model choice is informed using available and relevant prior knowledge, model transparency, graphically comparing survival curves alongside observed data to aid consideration of the reliability of the survival estimates, and consideration of how the treatment effect estimates can be incorporated within a decision model.",

      "abstract": "Gendered differences in workload distribution, in particular who spends time on low-promotability workplace tasks\u2014tasks that are essential for organizations yet do not typically lead to promotions\u2014contribute to persistent gender inequalities in workplaces. We examined how gender is implicated in the content, quality, and consequences of one low-promotability workplace task: assessment. By analyzing real-world behavioral data that include 33,456 in-the-moment numerical and textual evaluations of 359 resident physicians (subordinates) by 285 attending physicians (superordinates) in eight U.S. hospitals, and by combining qualitative methods and machine learning, we found that, compared to men, women attendings wrote more words in their comments to residents, used more job-related terms, and were more likely to provide helpful feedback, particularly when residents were struggling. Additionally, we found women residents were less likely to receive substantive evaluations, regardless of attending gender. Our findings suggest that workplace assessment is gendered in three ways: women (superordinates) spend more time on this low-promotability task, they are more cognitively engaged with assessment, and women (subordinates) are less likely to fully benefit from quality assessment. We conclude that workplaces would benefit from addressing pervasive inequalities hidden within workplace assessment, equalizing not only who provides this assessment work, but who does it well and equitably.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The Pulmonary Vascular Research Institute GoDeep meta\u2010registry is a collaboration of pulmonary hypertension (PH) reference centers across the globe. Merging worldwide PH data in a central meta\u2010registry to allow advanced analysis of the heterogeneity of PH and its groups/subgroups on a worldwide geographical, ethnical, and etiological landscape (ClinTrial. gov NCT05329714). Retrospective and prospective PH patient data (diagnosis based on catheterization; individuals with exclusion of PH are included as a comparator group) are mapped to a common clinical parameter set of more than 350 items, anonymized and electronically exported to a central server. Use and access is decided by the GoDeep steering board, where each center has one vote. As of April 2022, GoDeep comprised 15,742 individuals with 1.9 million data points from eight PH centers. Geographic distribution comprises 3990 enrollees (25%) from America and 11,752 (75%) from Europe. Eighty\u2010nine perecent were diagnosed with PH and 11% were classified as not PH and provided a comparator group. The retrospective observation period is an average of 3.5 years (standard error of the mean 0.04), with 1159 PH patients followed for over 10 years. Pulmonary arterial hypertension represents the largest PH group (42.6%), followed by Group 2 (21.7%), Group 3 (17.3%), Group 4 (15.2%), and Group 5 (3.3%). The age distribution spans several decades, with patients 60 years or older comprising 60%. The majority of patients met an intermediate risk profile upon diagnosis. Data entry from a further six centers is ongoing, and negotiations with &gt;10 centers worldwide have commenced. Using electronic interface\u2010based automated retrospective and prospective data transfer, GoDeep aims to provide in\u2010depth epidemiological and etiological understanding of PH and its various groups/subgroups on a global scale, offering insights for improved management.",

      "abstract": "Introduction Shoulder pain is common and associated with substantial morbidity. Different treatment strategies are being prescribed with equivocal results. Virtual reality (VR) is a novel technology and emerging research suggests that VR may be a promising alternative to current treatments. Prior to effectiveness research or any large-scale introduction, VR-applications require appropriate scrutiny including feasibility- and acceptability of clinicians and patients. Therefore, the aim of this study was to collect experiences of physiotherapists after using immersive VR. Methods A qualitative interpretive design was used to explore physiotherapists\u2019 experiences related to the use of VR for people with shoulder symptoms. 17 physiotherapists were asked to use VR at home for five days prior to a focus group interview. Data from the focus group interviews were analyzed using a six-phase process of thematic analysis. Results Three main themes were identified, each divided into subthemes. The main themes were: 1. VR as an extension of contemporary physiotherapy care: physiotherapists were positive about the potential of VR and its applicability in daily care. 2. Physiotherapist uncertainties of future care using VR: participants expressed concerns about their professional identity, particularly as patients engage in independent home exercises. 3. Physiotherapist's requirements for implementation of VR: participants shared their needs for evidence regarding the effectiveness and parameters such as frequency, dosage and intensity of the VR intervention. Conclusion Physiotherapists were positive about VR as an intervention tool. However, they felt more knowledge is needed about parameters of VR. The findings of this study inform researchers and technology developers about optimal design of interventions and applications using VR.",

      "abstract": "Healthcare provision, like many other sectors of society, is undergoing major changes due to the increased use of data-driven methods and technologies. This increased reliance on big data in medicine can lead to shifts in the norms that guide healthcare providers and patients. Continuous critical normative reflection is called for to track such potential changes. This article presents the results of an interview-based study with 20 German and Swiss experts from the fields of medicine, life science research, informatics and humanities of digitalisation. The aim of the study was to explore expert opinions regarding current challenges and opportunities related to data-driven medicine and medical research and to provide a methodological framework for empirically grounded, continuous normative reflection. To this end, we developed a heuristic tool to map and structure empirical findings for normative analysis. Using this tool, our interview material points to a polarisation between individualistic and collectivistic orientated argumentations among experts. The study shows that a multilevel analysis is required to deal with complex normative implications of data-driven approaches in medical research and healthcare.",

In this chapter, we present potential methods for predicting early, evolving cancers by leveraging readily available electronic health record (EHR) data and machine learning. We discuss the various aspects of our collaborative experience, involving clinical and computer scientists, in navigating the process of using EHRs to develop cancer risk prediction models. This chapter is intended to serve as a guide to others preforming this type of research. We cover the different steps involved, based on our initial experience of model development using single-institution data, including data acquisition, querying and downloading data, protecting patient confidentiality, data curation, model development, and validation. Challenges encountered when using single-institution data is presented, along with lessons learned. Drawing from our experience working with a federated database of EHR data from multiple institutions to develop a risk prediction model for PDAC, we also discuss how many of these challenges can be addressed by using such a federated database of EHR data. We also discuss future clinical opportunities that may arise from leveraging data from a federated network, such as the deployment of risk models for clinical studies.",

Study Design Cross\u2010sectional cohort. Setting Informational YouTube videos with subject matter \u201cGraves' Disease treatment.\u201d Method The top 50 videos based on our query were assessed using the DISCERN instrument. This validated algorithm discretely rates treatment\u2010related information from excellent (\u22654.5) to very poor (&lt;1.9). Videos were also screened for ATA guideline inclusion. Descriptive statistics were used for cohort characterization. Univariate and multivariate linear regressions characterized factors associated with DISCERN scores. Significance was set at P &lt; .05. Results The videos featured 57,513.43 views (SD = 162,579.25), 1054.70 likes (SD = 2329.77), and 168.80 comments (SD = 292.97). Most were patient education (52%) or patient experience (24%). A minority (40%) were made by thyroid specialists (endocrinologists, endocrine surgeons, or otolaryngologists). Under half did not mention all 3 treatment modalities (44%), and 54% did not mention any ATA recommendations. Overall, videos displayed poor reliability (mean = 2.26, SD = 0.67), treatment information quality (mean = 2.29, SD = 0.75), and overall video quality (mean = 2.47, SD = 1.07). Physician videos were associated with lower likes, views, and comments ( P &lt; .001) but higher DISCERN reliability ( P = .015) and overall score ( P = .019). Longer videos ( P = .015), patient accounts ( P = .013), and patient experience ( P = .002) were associated with lower scores. Conclusion The most available GD treatment content on YouTube varies significantly in the quality of medical information. This may contribute to suboptimal disease understanding, especially for patients highly engaged with online health information sources.",

      "title": "Fair space for life: A dynamic care monitor working up to growth and flourishing for all",
      "abstract": "Background: Mental health disparities persistently cause inequity and social exclusion. Extensive research underpins the need to embrace the social determinants of health and facilitate network learning at various ecosystem levels. Despite valuable quality frameworks and ratified conventions, local practices which counter health inequity are scarce. Methods: The Dutch HOP-TR study collected health and needs of Homeless Service Users (HSU) in a rights-based, transdiagnostic, recovery framework. We assessed the survival modes and conducted a socio-ecological analysis, exploring what happened in care pathways at three ecosystem levels: individual HSU, caregiver networks, society. While documenting vital conditions for growth and citizenship, we explore major opportunities to develop \u2018fair space for life\u2019. Results: Under low distress levels, prosocial behavior is prominent (32.9%). High distress levels are found with an avoidant (42.0%) or aggressive mode (24.9%). Rising distress levels give more frictions in relations, psychiatric admissions, and police-justice contacts. The distress-induced descent in the social hierarchy causes social withdrawal, alienation, and marginalization. At society level, fair conditions for growth and citizenship are challenged by the cumulative impact of distress over the HSU\u2019 lives. Discussion: This care monitor uncovers the impact of distress on caregiver interactions. The care pathways reveal that the survival strategies reflect a systematic, pervasive neglect. Unfair representations hold HSU personally responsible of their situation, disregarding the cumulative impact of environmental conditions over their lives. The diverse sources of unfairness are intrinsic to the health care system and culture. Therefore, the survival modes ask for profound culture transformations in a whole-system-whole-society approach. Conclusion: Given the need for action on health equity and the social determinants of health, this paper provides an example of a dynamic care monitor. The actionable data elicit dialogs and stimulate to enrich opportunities for inclusion and growth in communities and societies.",

However, it is not clear how accurate the tool is screening against diagnostic criteria in middle-income settings. Methods Embedded within the STRiDE programme, older adults (aged \u226565 years) and their informants were randomly recruited from four sites across Indonesia and South Africa. All informants were asked to complete DSRS. We report the tool\u2019s psychometric properties and accuracy against the 10/66 short diagnostic algorithm. Results Between September and December 2021, data was collected from 2110 older adults in Indonesia and 408 in South Africa. Overall, the DSRS scores significantly differed between those with and without dementia, as identified on the 10/66 short algorithm ( p &lt; .05). The difference between groups remained significant after controlling for key factors related to older adult and informant demographics. A score &gt;2 on the DSRS had the greatest agreement with the 10/66 short algorithm and had excellent discriminative properties in both Indonesia (Area Under Curve (AUC) = .75, 95% CIs = .72\u2013.77) and South Africa (AUC = .82, 95% CIs = .76\u2013.88).

These tumors can vary widely in their aggressiveness, location, and type, making early diagnosis and precise classification essential for improving patient outcomes and survival rates. The complexity of brain tumors, combined with the detailed nature of MRI scans, presents significant challenges in the diagnostic process, underscoring the need for advanced tools to support clinicians in making informed decisions. New Method: This study focuses on developing and evaluating a proposed model for brain tumor classification using MRI images. The model employs a transfer learning approach fine-tuned to the brain tumor dataset, explicitly utilizing the EfficientNetB0 architecture. Results: The proposed model achieved an outstanding overall accuracy of 0.99, with precision, recall, and F1 scores exceeding 0.98 across all tumor classes. Comparison with Existing Methods: These results demonstrate the model\u2019s potential as a reliable tool for assisting clinicians in diagnosing and classifying brain tumors.

Yet, the use of such data raises significant ethical questions about the need for the informed consent of those being studied. Consent mechanisms, if even obtained, are typically broad and inflexible, or place a significant burden on the participant. Machine learning algorithms show much promise for facilitating a \u201cmiddle-ground\u201d approach: using trained models to predict and automate granular consent decisions. Such techniques, however, raise a myriad of follow-on ethical and technical considerations.

      "abstract": "Recent efforts to rethink drug-related stigma have been increasingly considering the power dimension of the concept, to show how stigma formations flow top-down from governments, as well as other political or corporate stakeholders, towards the powerless and marginalised. Stigma attaches itself to the individual and collective identities of the substance-using subject. But it equally alters the multiple lives of the substance. In the US opioid crisis of recent decades, big pharma companies could be seen lobbying the medical profession and harnessing their power to destigmatise opioid painkillers, as part of wider marketing and sales strategies. This has been subsequently linked with rising opioid-related fatalities and spiralling harms among some of the most vulnerable groups. This theoretical paper locates the object-stigma of drugs between the cultural confines of \u2018limbic capitalism\u2019 (the drive to seek pleasure and meaning through consumption) and \u2018palliative capitalism\u2019 (the drive to pathologise and medicate ills attributed to the individual, but not the system). It argues that stigma should be viewed as a dynamic force which, under the guise of consumer culture and the veil of scientific rationality, can be manipulated by business elites to shift meanings around pain, pleasure, and addiction, in ways that are potentially conducive to social harms.",

      "abstract": "The potential role of prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) PET/CT in non-prostate cancer tumors has shown promising results. We examined the performance of dynamic <sup>68</sup>Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT (DPSMA) for the evaluation of localized renal mass. <b>Methods:</b> A prospective case series of patients with a newly diagnosed renal mass who were referred for surgery was examined. DPSMA was performed in a standardized manner before surgery. The final surgical histology served as the standard of reference. PSMA expression in the tumor vasculature was assessed and staining intensity was scored. Tracer uptake and PSMA expression were compared between benign and malignant tissue. <b>Results:</b> Of 29 enhancing renal masses evaluated in 27 patients, 24 (83%) were malignant lesions. The median SUV<sub>mean</sub> of benign and malignant lesions was 2.3 (interquartile range [IQR], 2.2-2.7) and 6.8 (IQR, 4.2-10.1), respectively (<i>P</i> = 0.009). Median SUV<sub>max</sub> of benign and malignant lesions was 3.8 (IQR, 3.3-4.5) and 9.4 (IQR, 5.4-15.8), respectively (<i>P</i> = 0.015). The median washout coefficient (<i>K</i><sub>2</sub>) was significantly lower in malignant lesions than in benign lesions (0.17 vs. 0.70, <i>P</i> = 0.02). Positive PSMA staining was found in 20 of 24 malignant lesions and in 2 of 5 benign lesions (<i>P</i> = 0.04). <b>Conclusion:</b> This pilot study demonstrated DPSMA uptake and kinetics in localized renal masses. Increased <sup>68</sup>Ga-PSMA-11 tracer uptake and intratumoral retention correlate with PSMA expression in malignant renal tumors compared with benign renal masses, supporting further assessment of DPSMA as a potential tool for evaluating localized renal masses.",

      "abstract": "Drawing on ethnographic, interview, and textual data with researchers creating machine learning solutions for health care, the author explains how researchers justify their projects while grappling with uncertainties about the benefits and harms of machine learning. Researchers differentiate between a hypothesized world of machine learning and a \u201creal\u201d world of clinical practice. Each world relates to distinct frameworks for describing, evaluating, and reconciling uncertainties. In the hypothesized world, impacts are hypothetical. They can be operationalized, controlled, and computed as bias and fairness. In the real world, impacts address patient outcomes in clinical settings. Real impacts are chaotic and uncontrolled and relate to complex issues of equity. To address real-world uncertainties, researchers collaborate closely with clinicians, who explain real-world implications, and participate in data generation projects to improve clinical datasets. Through these collaborations, researchers expand ethical discussions, while delegating moral responsibility to clinicians and medical infrastructure. This preserves the legitimacy of machine learning as a pure, technical domain, while allowing engagement with health care impacts. This article contributes an explanation of the interplay between technical and moral boundaries in shaping ethical dilemmas and responsibilities, and explains the significance of collaboration in artificial intelligence projects for ethical engagement.",

      "title": "A new machine learning model based on induction of rules for autism detection",
      "abstract": "Autism spectrum disorder is a developmental disorder that describes certain challenges associated with communication (verbal and non-verbal), social skills, and repetitive behaviors. Typically, autism spectrum disorder is diagnosed in a clinical environment by licensed specialists using procedures which can be lengthy and cost-ineffective. Therefore, scholars in the medical, psychology, and applied behavioral science fields have in recent decades developed screening methods such as the Autism Spectrum Quotient and Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers for diagnosing autism and other pervasive developmental disorders. The accuracy and efficiency of these screening methods rely primarily on the experience and knowledge of the user, as well as the items designed in the screening method. One promising direction to improve the accuracy and efficiency of autism spectrum disorder detection is to build classification systems using intelligent technologies such as machine learning. Machine learning offers advanced techniques that construct automated classifiers that can be exploited by users and clinicians to significantly improve sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and efficiency in diagnostic discovery. This article proposes a new machine learning method called Rules-Machine Learning that not only detects autistic traits of cases and controls but also offers users knowledge bases (rules) that can be utilized by domain experts in understanding the reasons behind the classification. Empirical results on three data sets related to children, adolescents, and adults show that Rules-Machine Learning offers classifiers with higher predictive accuracy, sensitivity, harmonic mean, and specificity than those of other machine learning approaches such as Boosting, Bagging, decision trees, and rule induction.",

      "title": "Power to Detect What? Considerations for Planning and Evaluating Sample Size",
      "abstract": "Academic Abstract In the wake of the replication crisis, social and personality psychologists have increased attention to power analysis and the adequacy of sample sizes. In this article, we analyze current controversies in this area, including choosing effect sizes, why and whether power analyses should be conducted on already-collected data, how to mitigate the negative effects of sample size criteria on specific kinds of research, and which power criterion to use. For novel research questions, we advocate that researchers base sample sizes on effects that are likely to be cost-effective for other people to implement (in applied settings) or to study (in basic research settings), given the limitations of interest-based minimums or field-wide effect sizes. We discuss two alternatives to power analysis, precision analysis and sequential analysis, and end with recommendations for improving the practices of researchers, reviewers, and journal editors in social-personality psychology. Public Abstract Recently, social-personality psychology has been criticized for basing some of its conclusions on studies with low numbers of participants. As a result, power analysis, a mathematical way to ensure that a study has enough participants to reliably \u201cdetect\u201d a given size of psychological effect, has become popular. This article describes power analysis and discusses some controversies about it, including how researchers should derive assumptions about effect size, and how the requirements of power analysis can be applied without harming research on hard-to-reach and marginalized communities. For novel research questions, we advocate that researchers base sample sizes on effects that are likely to be cost-effective for other people to implement (in applied settings) or to study (in basic research settings). We discuss two alternatives to power analysis, precision analysis and sequential analysis, and end with recommendations for improving the practices of researchers, reviewers, and journal editors in social-personality psychology.",

      "abstract": "We investigate why top-down directives aimed at eradicating corruption are ineffective at altering on-the-ground practices for organizations that have adopted industry-wide \u201cgold standards\u201d to prevent bribery and corruption. Using interview and focus group data collected from leading multinational pharmaceutical firms, we unearth antecedents contributing to organizations\u2019 systemic failure to embed their anticorruption policies in business practice. We identify two tensions that contribute to this disconnect: a culture clash between global and local norms, especially in emerging markets and a similar disconnect between the compliance and commercial functions. To overcome these tensions, we suggest that organizations are likely to find it easier to implement a no gifts policy if they cease to rely on local agents embedded in local norms and that there needs to be strong evidence of board-level commitment to antibribery programs, innovative ways of incentivizing compliant behavior, and a fundamental rethinking of organizations\u2019 business model and remuneration practices.",

      "abstract": "Objective Social, biological and environmental factors in early-life, defined as the period from preconception until age 18, play a role in shaping the risk of multiple long-term condition multimorbidity. However, there is a need to conceptualise these early-life factors, how they relate to each other, and provide conceptual framing for future research on aetiology and modelling prevention scenarios of multimorbidity. We develop a conceptual framework to characterise the population-level domains of early-life determinants of future multimorbidity. Method This work was conducted as part of the Multidisciplinary Ecosystem to study Lifecourse Determinants and Prevention of Early-onset Burdensome Multimorbidity (MELD-B) study. The conceptualisation of multimorbidity lifecourse determinant domains was shaped by a review of existing research evidence and policy, and co-produced with public involvement via two workshops. Results Early-life risk factors incorporate personal, social, economic, behavioural and environmental factors, and the key domains discussed in research evidence, policy, and with public contributors included adverse childhood experiences, socioeconomics, the social and physical environment, and education. Policy recommendations more often focused on individual-level factors as opposed to the wider determinants of health discussed within the research evidence. Some domains highlighted through our co-production process with public contributors, such as religion and spirituality, health screening and check-ups, and diet, were not adequately considered within the research evidence or policy. Conclusions This co-produced conceptualisation can inform research directions using primary and secondary data to investigate the early-life characteristics of population groups at risk of future multimorbidity, as well as policy directions to target public health prevention scenarios of early-onset multimorbidity.",

Qualitative data from 38 participants who were serving terms or working in three prison facilities in Ghana revealed three themes, including (a) fear over the spread of communicable diseases, (b) limited access to basic resources, and (c) psychological and emotional burden, attributing them to overcrowding in the prisons. We discussed the findings from human rights and prison and public security perspectives and concluded that addressing overcrowding in prisons would ensure a healthy prison environment, which may have implications for the well-being and human rights of persons in custody, as well as public safety and the health of prison officers and the community. To achieve a healthy prison, policies should target prison depopulation and commitment from stakeholders to implement local and international prison rules and conventions.",

A variety of high-dimensional MI techniques can help, but there has been limited research on their relative performance. In this study, we investigated a wide range of extant high-dimensional MI techniques that can handle a large number of predictors in the imputation models and general missing data patterns. We assessed the relative performance of seven high-dimensional MI methods with a Monte Carlo simulation study and a resampling study based on real survey data. The performance of the methods was defined by the degree to which they facilitate unbiased and confidence-valid estimates of the parameters of complete data analysis models. We found that using lasso penalty or forward selection to select the predictors used in the MI model and using principal component analysis to reduce the dimensionality of auxiliary data produce the best results.",

A search of 16 electronic databases produced 14,218 potential sources, which, after screening, resulted in 79 articles for inclusion. Papers were included if they used qualitative research methods about the barriers, facilitators, perceptions, experiences, and attitudes toward community reintegration from prison or secure care for men convicted of sexual offenses. Included papers were critically appraised and the findings were thematically synthesized. The findings identified that formal and cultural aspects of reintegration, such as probation services, stigmatization, and registration, were the three largest barriers that men faced upon their release, with stability aspects, such as positive relationships, religion, and support groups, being key facilitators to their successful reintegration. The implications for future research, and policy and practice, including prioritizing risk assessment and management, offering appropriate and timely treatment and rehabilitation, educating the community, better access to housing and employment, and services adopting a collaborative approach, are discussed.",

But despite the hype, pandemic drones largely failed to take to the sky and far from the scale initially imagined. This article pursues the failure of the pandemic drone to materialise, showing how it nevertheless functioned as a locus of experimentation for remote logics and processes. As such, we shift focus away from what the pandemic drone is to if and where it \u2013 or its logics \u2013 can be found. To learn from the pandemic drone, we turn to three trajectories of failure: failure as experiment, failure as imaginary and failure as glitch. With particular attention to specific case studies, we show how failure enables drone logics and processes to migrate across various socio-technical forms, sites and applications of automated decision-making responses to the pandemic.",

Against a backdrop of the theory of the paradox of technology with ideas of the networked self and child rights, the article explores the use of social technology with vulnerable/marginalised young people. Given the dearth in knowledge and understanding, in this area of social technology and young people in conflict with the law, the article focuses on an important, original and fast-developing issue in contemporary youth justice. Principally, the article explores the experiences and views of practitioners to promote a better understanding of the opportunities and challenges in the adoption of social technology in working with marginalised young people. Practitioner perceptions on the use of social technology in their own practice and its associated risks and benefits are also revealed. Study findings indicate that digital opportunities and challenges are embedded in organisational and cultural structures and practices. The article discusses implications for youth justice and ultimately for young people in conflict with the law who are caught up in the system. The article raises important issues about the likely increasing use of technology as a tool in rehabilitation and desistance; and its key messages will be of considerable interest to practitioners, managers and policy-makers who will have little option, as time goes on, to enter this controversial field.",

First, the capability to store and analyse large quantities of digital data obviates the need for data \u2018compression\u2019 that characterises Weberian-model bureaucracies, and facilitates data de-compression in data-intensive information regimes, where the capabilities of public agencies and civil society are both enhanced. Second, the increasing capability of robotic devices have expanded the range of tasks that machines extending or substituting workers\u2019 capabilities can perform, with implications for a reshaping of state organisation. Third, DSAI technologies allow new options for partitioning state functions in ways that can maximise organisational productivity, in an \u2018intelligent centre, devolved delivery\u2019 model within vertical policy sectors. Fourth, within each tier of government, DSAI technologies offer new possibilities for \u2018administrative holism\u2019 - the horizontal allocation of power and functions between organisations, through state integration, common capacity and needs-based joining-up of services. Together, these four themes comprise a third wave of DEG changes, suggesting important administrative choices to be made regarding information regimes, state organisation, functional allocation and outsourcing arrangements, as well as a long-term research agenda for public administration, requiring extensive and detailed analysis.",

      "abstract": "Background: Spondyloarthritis (SpA) is a group of related but phenotypically distinct inflammatory disorders that include axial SpA (axSpA) and psoriatic arthritis (PsA). Information on the characteristics and management of these patients in the real world remains scarce. Objectives: To explore the characteristics and management [disease activity assessment and treatment with secukinumab (SEC) or other biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (bDMARDs)] of axSpA and PsA patients using natural language processing (NLP) in Electronic Health Records (EHRs). Design: National, multicenter, observational, and retrospective study. Methods: We analyzed free-text and structured clinical information from EHR at three hospitals. All adult patients with axSpA, PsA or non-classified SpA from 2018 to 2021 with minimum follow-up of three months were included when starting SEC or other bDMARDs. Clinical variables were extracted using EHRead \u00ae technology based on Systemized Nomenclature of Medicine-Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT) terminology. Results: Out of 887,735 patients, 758 were included, of which 328 had axSpA [58.5% male; mean (SD) age of 50.7 (12.7) years], 365 PsA [54.8% female, 53.9 (12.4) years], and 65 non-classified SpA. Mean (SD) time since diagnosis was 36.8 (61.0) and 24.1 (35.2) months for axSpA and PsA, respectively. Only 116 axSpA patients (35.3%) had available Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score (ASDAS) or Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) at bDMARD onset, of which 61 presented active disease. Disease Activity in PSoriatic Arthritis (DAPSA) or Disease Assessment Score - 28 joints (DAS-28) values at bDMARD onset were available for only 61 PsA (16.7%) patients, with 23 of them having active disease. The number of patients with available tender joint count or swollen joint count assessment was 68 (20.7%) and 59 (18%) for axSpA, and 115 (31.5%) and 119 (32.6%) for PsA, respectively. SEC was used in 63 (19.2%) axSpA patients and in 63 (17.3%) PsA patients. Conclusion: Using NLP, the study showed that around one-third of axSpA and one-sixth of PsA patients have disease activity assessments with ASDAS/BASDAI or DAPSA/DAS-28, respectively, highlighting an area of improvement in these patients\u2019 management.",

      "abstract": "Background Previously, consensus MS care standards were defined by MS specialist neurologists from 19 countries. We developed, piloted and refined an Excel-based quality improvement tool to enable MS services to benchmark against these standards. Here, we examine the refined tool. Objective To determine the applicability of the quality improvement tool in different healthcare settings. Methods MS centres across the globe were invited to pilot the quality improvement tool by coding the medical records of 36 adults with MS. We invited feedback on user friendliness, quality improvement tool usefulness and relevance of data collected. Results Seventeen centres from 14 countries participated; 14 completed the post-service evaluation survey. Over 50% of responders rated the tool \u2018very easy\u2019 or \u2018easy\u2019 to use and \u2018very relevant\u2019 to their service. Almost 85% of responders (11/13) planned to introduce changes to their service, including improvements in documentation, communication, interactions with colleagues and referrals; 85% would use a future shorter version of the tool. Conclusions The quality improvement tool can enable MS centres globally to benchmark their services. Widespread uptake of a shorter tool may help MS centres to work towards achieving consensus standards for brain health-focused care. Incorporation into routine clinical practice would drive adoption.",

In Experiment 1 ( N = 124 adults), alongside our reanalysis of previously published data, we showed that White AI faces are judged as human more often than actual human faces\u2014a phenomenon we term AI hyperrealism. Paradoxically, people who made the most errors in this task were the most confident (a Dunning-Kruger effect). In Experiment 2 ( N = 610 adults), we used face-space theory and participant qualitative reports to identify key facial attributes that distinguish AI from human faces but were misinterpreted by participants, leading to AI hyperrealism. However, the attributes permitted high accuracy using machine learning. These findings illustrate how psychological theory can inform understanding of AI outputs and provide direction for debiasing AI algorithms, thereby promoting the ethical use of AI.",

      "abstract": "The development of artificial intelligence (AI) has revolutionised the medical system, empowering healthcare professionals to analyse complex nonlinear big data and identify hidden patterns, facilitating well-informed decisions. Over the last decade, there has been a notable trend of research in AI, machine learning (ML), and their associated algorithms in health and medical systems. These approaches have transformed the healthcare system, enhancing efficiency, accuracy, personalised treatment, and decision-making. Recognising the importance and growing trend of research in the topic area, this paper presents a bibliometric analysis of AI in health and medical systems. The paper utilises the Web of Science (WoS) Core Collection database, considering documents published in the topic area for the last four decades. A total of 64,063 papers were identified from 1983 to 2022. The paper evaluates the bibliometric data from various perspectives, such as annual papers published, annual citations, highly cited papers, and most productive institutions, and countries. The paper visualises the relationship among various scientific actors by presenting bibliographic coupling and co-occurrences of the author's keywords. The analysis indicates that the field began its significant growth in the late 1970s and early 1980s, with significant growth since 2019. The most influential institutions are in the USA and China. The study also reveals that the scientific community's top keywords include \u2018ML\u2019, \u2018Deep Learning\u2019, and \u2018Artificial Intelligence\u2019.",

      "abstract": "Background Body weight has been implicated as a risk factor for latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) and the active disease. Design and methods This study aimed to develop artificial neural network (ANN) models for predicting LTBI from body weight and other host-related disease risk factors. We used datasets from participants of the US-National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES; 2012; n=5,156; 514 with LTBI and 4,642 controls) to develop three ANNs employing body mass index (BMI, Network I), BMI and HbA1C (as a proxy for diabetes; Network II) and BMI, HbA1C and education (as a proxy for socioeconomic status; Network III). The models were trained on n=1018 age- and sex-matched subjects equally distributed between the control and LTBI groups. The endpoint was the prediction of LTBI. Results When data was adjusted for age, sex, diabetes and level of education, odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for risk of LTBI with increased BMI was 0.85 (95%CI: 0.77 \u2013 0.96, p=0.01). The three ANNs had a predictive accuracy varied from 75 to 80% with sensitivities ranged from 85% to 94% and specificities of approximately 70%. Areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) were between 0.82 and 0.87. Optimal ANN performance was noted using BMI as a risk indicator. Conclusion Body weight can be employed in developing artificial intelligence-based tool to predict LTBI. This can be useful in precise decision making in clinical and public health practices aiming to curb the burden of tuberculosis, e.g., in the management and monitoring of the tuberculosis prevention programs and to evaluate the impact of healthy weight on tuberculosis risk and burden.",

      "title": "A Review of <i>In Silico</i> Tools as Alternatives to Animal Testing: Principles, Resources and Applications",
      "abstract": "Across the spectrum of industrial sectors, including pharmaceuticals, chemicals, personal care products, food additives and their associated regulatory agencies, there is a need to develop robust and reliable methods to reduce or replace animal testing. It is generally recognised that no single alternative method will be able to provide a one-to-one replacement for assays based on more complex toxicological endpoints. Hence, information from a combination of techniques is required. A greater understanding of the time and concentration-dependent mechanisms, underlying the interactions between chemicals and biological systems, and the sequence of events that can lead to apical effects, will help to move forward the science of reducing and replacing animal experiments. In silico modelling, in vitro assays, high-throughput screening, organ-on-a-chip technology, omics and mathematical biology, can provide complementary information to develop a complete picture of the potential response of an organism to a chemical stressor. Adverse outcome pathways (AOPs) and systems biology frameworks enable relevant information from diverse sources to be logically integrated. While individual researchers do not need to be experts across all disciplines, it is useful to have a fundamental understanding of what other areas of science have to offer, and how knowledge can be integrated with other disciplines. The purpose of this review is to provide those who are unfamiliar with predictive in silico tools, with a fundamental understanding of the underlying theory. Current applications, software, barriers to acceptance, new developments and the use of integrated approaches are all discussed, with additional resources being signposted for each of the topics.",

      "abstract": "Conversation\u2014a verbal interaction between two or more people\u2014is a complex, pervasive, and consequential human behavior. Conversations have been studied across many academic disciplines. However, advances in recording and analysis techniques over the last decade have allowed researchers to more directly and precisely examine conversations in natural contexts and at a larger scale than ever before, and these advances open new paths to understand humanity and the social world. Existing reviews of text analysis and conversation research have focused on text generated by a single author (e.g., product reviews, news articles, and public speeches) and thus leave open questions about the unique challenges presented by interactive conversation data (i.e., dialogue). In this article, we suggest approaches to overcome common challenges in the workflow of conversation science, including recording and transcribing conversations, structuring data (to merge turn-level and speaker-level data sets), extracting and aggregating linguistic features, estimating effects, and sharing data. This practical guide is meant to shed light on current best practices and empower more researchers to study conversations more directly\u2014to expand the community of conversation scholars and contribute to a greater cumulative scientific understanding of the social world.",

      "abstract": "In metropolitan areas worldwide, abandoned properties are prevalent, prompting a need for small urban green spaces (SUGS) to meet the growing demand. Understanding residents\u2019 preferences and perceptions of transformed spaces is vital for effective urban design. This study delves into residents\u2019 preferences and perceptions regarding the transformation of such spaces into SUGS and their impact on psychological well-being. By examining how these preferences and perceived health benefits shape the value of transformed spaces, the research aims to inform effective urban design strategies. The participants underwent visual stimulation, with psychological reactions recorded through Electroencephalogram (EEG) readings and assessed via Questionnaire. Machine learning techniques analyzed EEG sub-band data, achieving an average accuracy of 92.8% when comparing leftover and designed spaces. Results revealed that different types of transformed spaces provoke distinct physiological and preference responses. Specifically, viewing SUGS was associated with significant changes in gamma wave power, suggesting a correlation between enhanced gamma activity and increased feelings of empathy. Moreover, participants also reported enhanced comfort, relaxation, and overall mood, and a strong preference for SUGS over untransformed spaces, emphasizing the value placed on these areas for their health benefits. This research highlights the positive impact of even SUGS on mental health, using EEG data to assess emotional states triggered by urban spaces. The study concludes with a call for further research to investigate the long-term benefits of SUGS on well-being, alongside an exploration of the gamma band as a neural marker for emotional restoration in urban green spaces. This research highlights the crucial role of urban design in fostering psychological well-being through the strategic development of green spaces, suggesting a paradigm shift toward more inclusive, health-promoting urban environments.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: This exploratory study examines the function and use of common spaces in assisted living facilities (ALFs) from the residential and workplace perspectives. BACKGROUND: The impact of the physical environment on human activities in healthcare settings has been emphasized in many studies. Few studies, however, have explored the daily use of common spaces and the impact on the usability of ALFs. METHODS: Four explorative methods\u2013observation, group interviews, individual interviews, and questionnaires\u2014were used to investigate 14 ALFs in Sweden. The study involves residents, staff, relatives, architects, and people responsible for planning and construction of eldercare. This research strategy combines quantitative and qualitative methods to enhance the validity of the results. Method triangulation and data triangulation were used and the data were analyzed using Qualitative Content Analysis (QCA). RESULTS: The results show that residents and staff have different objectives for use and these differences affect usability, although explicit conflicts are rare. The residents, staff, and other stakeholders have different views about the demarcation of home and workplace and the role of common spaces as venues for social interaction. CONCLUSIONS: Both the residential and the workplace perspective must be considered when planning assisted living facilities. Otherwise, inherent conflicts between these perspectives will manifest as a result of the physical design. Common spaces have diverse functions that are reflected in their spatial organization. Therefore, ALFs should be designed so the intended function of a specific space is apparent to all users.",

      "title": "Hereditary spastic paraplegia: Novel insights into the pathogenesis and management",
      "abstract": "Hereditary spastic paraplegia is a genetically heterogeneous neurodegenerative disorder characterised primarily by muscle stiffness in the lower limbs. Neurodegenerative disorders are conditions that result from cellular and metabolic abnormalities, many of which have strong genetic ties. While ageing is a known contributor to these changes, certain neurodegenerative disorders can manifest early in life, progressively affecting a person\u2019s quality of life. Hereditary spastic paraplegia is one such condition that can appear in individuals of any age. In hereditary spastic paraplegia, a distinctive feature is the degeneration of long nerve fibres in the corticospinal tract of the lower limbs. This degeneration is linked to various cellular and metabolic processes, including mitochondrial dysfunction, remodelling of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, autophagy, abnormal myelination processes and alterations in lipid metabolism. Additionally, hereditary spastic paraplegia affects processes like endosome membrane trafficking, oxidative stress and mitochondrial DNA polymorphisms. Disease-causing genetic loci and associated genes influence the progression and severity of hereditary spastic paraplegia, potentially affecting various cellular and metabolic functions. Although hereditary spastic paraplegia does not reduce a person\u2019s lifespan, it significantly impairs their quality of life as they age, particularly with more severe symptoms. Regrettably, there are currently no treatments available to halt or reverse the pathological progression of hereditary spastic paraplegia. This review aims to explore the metabolic mechanisms underlying the pathophysiology of hereditary spastic paraplegia, emphasising the interactions of various genes identified in recent network studies. By comprehending these associations, targeted molecular therapies that address these biochemical processes can be developed to enhance treatment strategies for hereditary spastic paraplegia and guide clinical practice effectively.",

      "title": "Leveraging AI to improve disease screening among American Indians: insights from the Strong Heart Study",
      "abstract": "Screening tests for disease have their performance measured through sensitivity and specificity, which inform how well the test can discriminate between those with and without the condition. Typically, high values for sensitivity and specificity are desired. These two measures of performance are unaffected by the outcome prevalence of the disease in the population. Research projects into the health of the American Indian frequently develop Machine learning algorithms as predictors of conditions in this population. In essence, these models serve as in silico screening tests for disease. A screening test\u2019s sensitivity and specificity values, typically determined during the development of the test, inform on the performance at the population level and are not affected by the prevalence of disease. A screening test\u2019s positive predictive value (PPV) is susceptible to the prevalence of the outcome. As the number of artificial intelligence and machine learning models flourish to predict disease outcomes, it is crucial to understand if the PPV values for these in silico methods suffer as traditional screening tests in a low prevalence outcome environment. The Strong Heart Study (SHS) is an epidemiological study of the American Indian and has been utilized in predictive models for health outcomes. We used data from the SHS focusing on the samples taken during Phases V and VI. Logistic Regression, Artificial Neural Network, and Random Forest were utilized as in silico screening tests within the SHS group. Their sensitivity, specificity, and PPV performance were assessed with health outcomes of varying prevalence within the SHS subjects. Although sensitivity and specificity remained high in these in silico screening tests, the PPVs\u2019 values declined as the outcome\u2019s prevalence became rare. Machine learning models used as in silico screening tests are subject to the same drawbacks as traditional screening tests when the outcome to be predicted is of low prevalence.",

      "title": "Just public algorithms: Mapping public engagement with the use of algorithms in UK public services",
      "abstract": "This paper proposes and models a novel approach to public engagement with the use of algorithms in public services. Algorithms pose significant risks which need to be anticipated and mitigated through democratic governance, including public engagement. We argue that as the challenge of creating responsible algorithms within a dynamic innovation system is one that will never definitively be accomplished \u2013 and as public engagement is not singular or pre-given but is always constructed through performance and in relation to other processes and events \u2013 public engagement with algorithms needs to be conducted and conceptualised as relational, systemic, and ongoing. We use a systemic mapping approach to map and analyse 77 cases of public engagement with the use of algorithms in public services in the UK 2013\u20132020 and synthesise the potential benefits and risks of these approaches articulated across the cases. The mapping shows there was already a diversity of public engagement on this topic in the UK by 2020, involving a wide range of different policy areas, framings of the problem, affordances of algorithms, publics, and formats of public engagement. While many of the cases anticipate benefits from the adoption of these technologies, they also raise a range of concerns which mirror much of the critical literature and highlight how algorithmic approaches may sometimes foreclose alternative options for policy delivery. The paper concludes by considering how this approach could be adopted on an ongoing basis to ensure the responsible governance of algorithms in public services, through a \u2018public engagement observatory\u2019.",

Drawing upon interviews conducted with senior Australian government administrators and researchers, I argue that FRTs are being used to respond to the trauma of disaster through its novel mediation and refiguration, tied to discourses of resilience which have been used to justify the expansion of FRT as a means for relief and the provision of aid. This legitimation, however, is challenged by the difficulty FRT encounters in capturing the face in its vital and its mortal malleability. What I term \u2018the problem of the corpse\u2019 serves to bring to light the \u2018paranoid\u2019 gaze of the biometric apparatus, disrupting the aim of using biometric infrastructure to produce a \u2018new normal\u2019 in the ongoing aftermath of disaster.",

      "abstract": "The issue of marketing efficiency, or how to better transform inputs into outputs within a marketing system, has always occupied a special place in the macromarketing literature. The concept of marketing efficiency has not been studied in closed and isolated systems that exhibit distinctive behavioral patterns compared to conventional open systems and can explain important and understudied marketing phenomena, including autarky. This study challenges some of the conventional premises of marketing systems by defining autarky as a closed marketing system that 1) operates with the specific purpose of propaganda in a relatively predictable and efficient manner; 2) has minimal, though not entirely absent, interaction with the international environment; and 3) involves participants (actors) who do not engage in voluntary exchanges with one another but rather collectively, as well as individually, adhere consistently to the self-reliance ideology. We demonstrate how a classical thermodynamic model (i.e., the Carnot cycle for maximum energy efficiency) can be metaphorically associated with the behavior of the North Korean autarkic system to better understand the long-term efficiency of its propaganda machine. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to develop a holistic metaphorical framework for exploring the efficiency of an autarkic system and to establish common criteria for measuring relationships between autarkic properties and autarkic processes.",

The precise measurement of physical activity is key to many surveillance and epidemiological studies investigating trends and associations with disease. Public health initiatives aimed at increasing physical activity rely on the measurement of physical activity to monitor their effectiveness. Physical activity is multidimensional, and a complex behaviour to measure; its various domains are often misunderstood. Inappropriate or crude measures of physical activity have serious implications, and are likely to lead to misleading results and underestimate effect size. In this review, key definitions and theoretical aspects, which underpin the measurement of physical activity, are briefly discussed. Methodologies particularly suited for use in epidemiological research are reviewed, with particular reference to their validity, primary outcome measure and considerations when using each in the field. It is acknowledged that the choice of method may be a compromise between accuracy level and feasibility, but the ultimate choice of tool must suit the stated aim of the research. A framework is presented to guide researchers on the selection of the most suitable tool for use in a specific study.",

      "abstract": "In the last decade there has been a proliferation of research on misinformation. One important aspect of this work that receives less attention than it should is exactly why misinformation is a problem. To adequately address this question, we must first look to its speculated causes and effects. We examined different disciplines (computer science, economics, history, information science, journalism, law, media, politics, philosophy, psychology, sociology) that investigate misinformation. The consensus view points to advancements in information technology (e.g., the Internet, social media) as a main cause of the proliferation and increasing impact of misinformation, with a variety of illustrations of the effects. We critically analyzed both issues. As to the effects, misbehaviors are not yet reliably demonstrated empirically to be the outcome of misinformation; correlation as causation may have a hand in that perception. As to the cause, advancements in information technologies enable, as well as reveal, multitudes of interactions that represent significant deviations from ground truths through people\u2019s new way of knowing (intersubjectivity). This, we argue, is illusionary when understood in light of historical epistemology. Both doubts we raise are used to consider the cost to established norms of liberal democracy that come from efforts to target the problem of misinformation.",

      "abstract": "Background: Personalized prediction of the risk of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (sICH) after stroke thrombolysis is clinically useful. Machine-learning-based modeling may provide the personalized prediction of the risk of sICH after stroke thrombolysis. Methods: We identified 2578 thrombolysis-treated ischemic stroke patients between January 2013 and December 2016 from a multicenter database, where 70% were used to train models and the remaining 30% were used as the nominal test sets. Another 136 consecutive tissue plasminogen-activated-treated patients between January 2017 and December 2017 from our institute were enrolled as the independent test sets for clinical usability evaluation. Five machine-learning models were developed to predict the risk of sICH after stroke thrombolysis, and the receiving operating characteristic (ROC) was used to compare the prediction performance. Results: In total, 2237 cases were included in our study, of which 102 had sICH transformation (4.56%). Finally, the three-layer neuro network was selected with the best performance on nominal test sets (AUC = 0.82). The probability of the model score was further categorized into three risk ranks (18.97%, 5.63%, and 0.81%) according to the risk distribution. Implementing our system in clinical practice was associated with reduced computed tomography (CT)-to-treatment time (CTT; 41 min versus 52 min, p &lt; 0.001). All sICH patients were correctly predicted to be within the high-sICH risk rank. Conclusions: The machine-learning-based modeling is feasible for providing personalized risk prediction of sICH after stroke thrombolysis, and is able to reduce the CTT. More data are needed to further optimize the model and improve the accuracy of prediction.",

      "abstract": "Objective. To estimate the benefit of PSA-based screening for prostate cancer from the patient and societal perspectives. Method. A partially observable Markov decision process model was used to optimize PSA screening decisions. Age-specific prostate cancer incidence rates and the mortality rates from prostate cancer and competing causes were considered. The model trades off the potential benefit of early detection with the cost of screening and loss of patient quality of life due to screening and treatment. PSA testing and biopsy decisions are made based on the patient\u2019s probability of having prostate cancer. Probabilities are inferred based on the patient\u2019s complete PSA history using Bayesian updating. Data Sources. The results of all PSA tests and biopsies done in Olmsted County, Minnesota, from 1993 to 2005 (11,872 men and 50,589 PSA test results). Outcome Measures. Patients\u2019 perspective: to maximize expected quality-adjusted life years (QALYs); societal perspective: to maximize the expected monetary value based on societal willingness to pay for QALYs and the cost of PSA testing, prostate biopsies, and treatment. Results. From the patient perspective, the optimal policy recommends stopping PSA testing and biopsy at age 76. From the societal perspective, the stopping age is 71. The expected incremental benefit of optimal screening over the traditional guideline of annual PSA screening with threshold 4.0 ng/mL for biopsy is estimated to be 0.165 QALYs per person from the patient perspective and 0.161 QALYs per person from the societal perspective. PSA screening based on traditional guidelines is found to be worse than no screening at all. Conclusions. PSA testing done with traditional guidelines underperforms and therefore underestimates the potential benefit of screening. Optimal screening guidelines differ significantly depending on the perspective of the decision maker.",

Eligible patients were \u226518 years old at first CUD diagnosis (index event) and had a PAH diagnosis on or after index date. Based on administrative codes, PAH was defined as right heart catheterization (RHC), \u2265 2 PAH diagnoses (1 within a year of RHC), and \u22651 post\u2010RHC prescription for PAH treatment. All values are median (1st quartile\u20133rd quartile) unless otherwise stated. Of 854,722 patients with CUD in the claims database, 582 (0.1%) had PAH. Time from CUD to PAH diagnosis was 2.26 (0.73\u20134.22) years. PAH patients experienced 3 (2\u20134) transthoracic echocardiograms (TTEs), 6 (3\u201312) specialist visits, and 2 (1\u20134) hospitalizations during the diagnostic interval. Almost one\u2010third of patients (29%) waited 10 months or more to have a TTE. Findings from the EHR database were broadly similar. Resource utilization during the diagnostic interval was also analyzed in an overall PH cohort: findings were generally similar to the PAH cohort (2 [1\u20133] TTEs, 4 [2\u20139] specialist visits and 2 [1\u20134] hospitalizations). These data indicate a delay in the diagnostic pathway for PAH, and illustrate the burden associated with PAH diagnosis.",

      "title": "Software-related challenges in Swedish healthcare through the lens of incident reports: A desktop study",
      "abstract": "Objective To identify a subset of software issues occurring in daily Swedish healthcare practice and devise a set of local solutions to overcome the challenges. Methods A sample of 46 incident reports was collected from one of Sweden's national incident reporting repositories, ranging from June 2019 to December 2021. The reports were first subjected to an algorithm to identify if they were health information technology-related incidents and were analysed using an existing framework, i.e., the Health Information Technology Classification System, to identify the software-related incidents. The incidents associated with software issues were then subjected to thematic analysis, in which themes were extracted and presented under the category assigned by the existing framework used. Results Of 46 reports, 45 (with one exception) were included using the algorithm. Of 45 incidents, 31 software-related incidents were identified using the classification system. Six types of software issues were identified, including software functionality ( n = 10), interface with other software systems or components ( n = 10), system configuration ( n = 7), interface with devices ( n = 2), record migration ( n = 1) and increased volume of transactions ( n = 1). Each issue was further categorised into different themes; for example, software interface-related problems were grouped into \u2018two patients being active in the system simultaneously\u2019 ( n = 6) and \u2018transfer of patient information\u2019 ( n = 4). Conclusions The study provided some insights into software issues and relevant consequences. A set of local solutions were devised to overcome the present challenges encountered in Swedish healthcare in their daily clinical practice. Systematic identification and characterisation of such software challenges should be a routine part of clinical practice for all major health information technology implementations.",

      "abstract": "The objective 1 of this study was to investigate trends in breast cancer (BC) prediction using machine learning (ML) publications by analysing country, first author, journal, institutional collaborations and co-occurrence of author keywords. The objective 2 was to provide a review of studies on BC prediction using ML and a blood analysis dataset (Breast Cancer Coimbra Dataset [BCCD]), and the objective 3 was to provide a brief review of studies based on BC prediction using ML and patients\u2019 fine needle aspirate cytology data (Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset [WBCD]). The design of this study was as follows: for objective 1: bibliometric analysis, data source PubMed (2015-2019); for objective 2: systematic review, data source: Google and Google Scholar (2018-2019); for objective 3: systematic review, data source: Google Scholar (2016-2019). The inclusion criteria for objective 1 were all publication results yielded from the searches. All English papers that had a \u2018PDF\u2019 option from the search results were included for objective 2. A sample of the \u2018PDF\u2019 English papers were included for objective 3. All 116 female patients from the BCCD, consisting of 64 positive BC patients and 52 controls were included in the study for objective 2. For the WBCD, all 699 female patients comprising of 458 with a benign BC tumour and 241 with a malignant BC tumour were included for objective 3. All 2928 publications were included for objective 1. The results showed that the United States of America (USA) produced the highest number of publications (n=803). In total, 2419 first authors contributed towards the publications. Breast Cancer Research and Treatment was the highest ranked journal. Institutional collaborations mainly occurred within the USA. The use of ML for BC screening and detection was the most researched topic. A total of 19 distinct papers were included for objectives 2 and 3. The findings from these studies were never presented to clinicians for validations. In conclusion, the use of ML for BC screening and detection is promising.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Many patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) experience substantial delays in diagnosis, which is associated with worse outcomes and higher costs. Tools for diagnosing PAH sooner may lead to earlier treatment, which may delay disease progression and adverse outcomes including hospitalization and death. We developed a machine\u2010learning (ML) algorithm to identify patients at risk for PAH earlier in their symptom journey and distinguish them from patients with similar early symptoms not at risk for developing PAH. Our supervised ML model analyzed retrospective, de\u2010identified data from the US\u2010based Optum\u00ae Clinformatics\u00ae Data Mart claims database (January 2015 to December 2019). Propensity score matched PAH and non\u2010PAH (control) cohorts were established based on observed differences. Random forest models were used to classify patients as PAH or non\u2010PAH at diagnosis and at 6 months prediagnosis. The PAH and non\u2010PAH cohorts included 1339 and 4222 patients, respectively. At 6 months prediagnosis, the model performed well in distinguishing PAH and non\u2010PAH patients, with area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic of 0.84, recall (sensitivity) of 0.73, and precision of 0.50. Key features distinguishing PAH from non\u2010PAH cohorts were a longer time between first symptom and the prediagnosis model date (i.e., 6 months before diagnosis); more diagnostic and prescription claims, circulatory claims, and imaging procedures, leading to higher overall healthcare resource utilization; and more hospitalizations. Our model distinguishes between patients with and without PAH at 6 months before diagnosis and illustrates the feasibility of using routine claims data to identify patients at a population level who might benefit from PAH\u2010specific screening and/or earlier specialist referral.",

      "abstract": "Objective Digital twins (DTs) have received widespread attention recently, providing new ideas and possibilities for future healthcare. This review aims to provide a quantitative review to analyze specific study contents, research focus, and trends of DT in healthcare. Simultaneously, this review intends to expand the connotation of \u201chealthcare\u201d into two directions, namely \u201cDisease treatment\u201d and \u201cHealth enhancement\u201d to analyze the content within the \u201cDT + healthcare\u201d field thoroughly. Methods A data mining method named Structure Topic Modeling (STM) was used as the analytical tool due to its topic analysis ability and versatility. Google Scholar, Web of Science, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure supplied the material papers in this review. Results A total of 94 high-quality papers published between 2018 and 2022 were gathered and categorized into eight topics, collectively covering the transformative impact across a broader spectrum in healthcare. Three main findings have emerged: (1) papers published in healthcare predominantly concentrate on technology development (artificial intelligence, Internet of Things, etc.) and application scenarios(personalized, precise, and real-time health service); (2) the popularity of research topics is influenced by various factors, including policies, COVID-19, and emerging technologies; and (3) the preference for topics is diverse, with a general inclination toward the attribute of \u201cHealth enhancement.\u201d Conclusions This review underscores the significance of real-time capability and accuracy in shaping the future of DT, where algorithms and data transmission methods assume central importance in achieving these goals. Moreover, technological advancements, such as omics and Metaverse, have opened up new possibilities for DT in healthcare. These findings contribute to the existing literature by offering quantitative insights and valuable guidance to keep researchers ahead of the curve.",

      "abstract": "Background: The unprecedented situation caused by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has profoundly affected endoscopic practice in regard to access, volume, and workflow. We aimed to assess the potential changes in the technical outcomes of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) procedures carried out in patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods: We conducted an international, multicenter, retrospective, matched case-control study of ERCP procedures carried out in patients with confirmed COVID-19. The main outcome was technical success of the procedure as assessed by the endoscopist, and the secondary outcome was the development of procedure-related adverse events. Each case was matched in a 1:4 ratio with controls extracted from each center\u2019s database in order to identify relevant changes in outcome measures compared with the pre-pandemic era. Results: Eighteen procedures performed in 16 COVID-19 patients [14 men, 65 years (9\u201382)] and 67 controls were included in the final analysis. Technical success was achieved in 14/18 COVID-19 cases, which was significantly lower as compared with the control group (14/18 versus 64/67, p = 0.034), with an endoscopic reintervention required in 9/18 cases. However, the rate of procedure-related adverse events was low in both groups (1/18 versus 10/67, p = 0.44). On multivariable analysis, COVID-19 status remained the only risk factor for technical failure of the procedure [odds ratio of 19.9 (95% confidence interval 1.4\u2013269.0)]. Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the volume and practice of ERCP, resulting in lower technical success rates without significantly impacting patient safety. Prioritizing cases and following recommendations on safety measures can ensure good outcome with minimal risk in dedicated centers.",

      "abstract": "Background: Real-world studies of people with type 2 diabetes (T2D) have shown insufficient dose adjustment during basal insulin titration in clinical practice leading to suboptimal treatment. Thus, 60% of people with T2D treated with insulin do not reach glycemic targets. This emphasizes a need for methods supporting efficient and individualized basal insulin titration of people with T2D. However, no systematic review of basal insulin dose guidance for people with T2D has been found. Objective: To provide an overview of basal insulin dose guidance methods that support titration of people with T2D and categorize these methods by characteristics, effect, and user experience. Methods: The review was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. Studies about basal insulin dose guidance, including adults with T2D on basal insulin analogs published before September 7, 2022, were included. Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal checklists were applied to assess risk of bias. Results: In total, 35 studies were included, and three categories of dose guidance were identified: paper-based titration algorithms, telehealth solutions, and mathematical models. Heterogeneous reporting of glycemic outcomes challenged comparison of effect between the three categories. Few studies assessed user experience. Conclusions: Studies mainly used titration algorithms to titrate basal insulin as telehealth or in paper format, except for studies using mathematical models. A numerically larger proportion of participants seemed to reach target using telehealth solutions compared to paper-based titration algorithms. Exploring capabilities of machine learning may provide insights that could pioneer future research while focusing on holistic development.",

The news-based content analysis identified 24 police officers who were arrested for crimes involving inappropriate use of TASERs over a 65-month period from January 2005 to May 2010. Data on these cases are presented in terms of: (a) the arrested officer, (b) victim characteristics, and (c) the situational context of these events. The news-based content analyses were used to identify and describe some factors that were common among these events, especially with regard to the actions and motivations of the arrested officers and how the situational context appeared to influence the criminal misconduct of officers. The findings indicate that the cases examined did not involve much, if any, situational risk to the officer. The criminal misuse of TASERs seems more likely to involve suspects who are already handcuffed, or even citizens who are clearly not criminals at all.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Remote exercise tests for patients with pulmonary hypertension (PH) would improve the telemedicine strategies in this disease. The PHRET study assessed the validity and feasibility of four remote exercise tests performed by PH patients at home. Participants undergoing diagnostic assessment for PH were included. At baseline, patients completed a 6MWT followed by a range of study tests including a Timed Up and Go (TUG) test, a Sit\u2010to\u2010Stand (STS), a Step Test (ST), and a tele\u20106MWT (T6MWT) performed outside using a GPS\u2010enabled smartphone. Patients performed these tests at home following discharge and at first follow\u2010up. Analysis focused on comparing the results of study tests to the standard 6MWT. The discontinuation rate was 15%. Ninety\u2010seven percent of patients were able to complete a TUG, 92% a STS, 73% a ST, and 49% a T6MWT. At baseline, correlation between the standard 6MWT and study tests, respectively, was T6MWT 0.93, ST 0.78, STS 0.71, and TUG \u22120.76 ( p &lt; 0.001). Direction of change in the study test agreed with the standard 6MWT in 68% of the follow\u2010up ST, 68% of the STS, 71% of the TUG, and 79% of the T6MWT. Patients were able to complete the tests at home, there were no adverse incidents and \u226592% of patients were happy to continue performing home tests. Remote exercise testing is feasible. The T6MWT was a valid remote measure of exercise capacity, but could only be performed by a limited number of patients. The high discontinuation rate may impact the utility of remote tests.",

      "title": "Machine Learning Methods to Estimate Individualized Treatment Effects for Use in Health Technology Assessment",
      "abstract": "Background Recent developments in causal inference and machine learning (ML) allow for the estimation of individualized treatment effects (ITEs), which reveal whether treatment effectiveness varies according to patients\u2019 observed covariates. ITEs can be used to stratify health policy decisions according to individual characteristics and potentially achieve greater population health. Little is known about the appropriateness of available ML methods for use in health technology assessment. Methods In this scoping review, we evaluate ML methods available for estimating ITEs, aiming to help practitioners assess their suitability in health technology assessment. We present a taxonomy of ML approaches, categorized by key challenges in health technology assessment using observational data, including handling time-varying confounding and time-to event data and quantifying uncertainty. Results We found a wide range of algorithms for simpler settings with baseline confounding and continuous or binary outcomes. Not many ML algorithms can handle time-varying or unobserved confounding, and at the time of writing, no ML algorithm was capable of estimating ITEs for time-to-event outcomes while accounting for time-varying confounding. Many of the ML algorithms that estimate ITEs in longitudinal settings do not formally quantify uncertainty around the point estimates. Limitations This scoping review may not cover all relevant ML methods and algorithms as they are continuously evolving. Conclusions Existing ML methods available for ITE estimation are limited in handling important challenges posed by observational data when used for cost-effectiveness analysis, such as time-to-event outcomes, time-varying and hidden confounding, or the need to estimate sampling uncertainty around the estimates. Implications ML methods are promising but need further development before they can be used to estimate ITEs for health technology assessments. Highlights Estimating individualized treatment effects (ITEs) using observational data and machine learning (ML) can support personalized treatment advice and help deliver more customized information on the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of health technologies. ML methods for ITE estimation are mostly designed for handling confounding at baseline but not time-varying or unobserved confounding. The few models that account for time-varying confounding are designed for continuous or binary outcomes, not time-to-event outcomes. Not all ML methods for estimating ITEs can quantify the uncertainty of their predictions. Future work on developing ML that addresses the concerns summarized in this review is needed before these methods can be widely used in clinical and health technology assessment\u2013like decision making.",

The new ARPA method theoretically guarantees that no two physicians\u2019 assigned patient loads can differ by more than one, either partially (by acuity levels) or in total; whereas SRPA guarantees only the latter. The performance of the ARPA method was assessed in practice in the ED of the main public hospital (Hospital Compound of Navarra) in the region of Navarre in Spain. This ED attends over 140 000 patients every year. Data analysis was conducted on 9,063 ED patients in the SRPA cohort, and 8,892 ED patients in the ARPA cohort. The metrics of interest are related both to patient access to healthcare and physician workload distribution: patient length of stay; arrival-to-provider time; ratio of patients exceeding the APT target threshold; and range of assigned patients across physicians by priority levels. The transition from SRPA to ARPA is associated with improvements in all ED operational metrics. This research demonstrates that ARPA is a simple and useful strategy for redesigning front-end ED processes.",

      "title": "Specific multimorbidity patterns modify the impact of an exercise intervention in older hospitalized adults",
      "abstract": "Background Different multimorbidity patterns present with different prognoses, but it is unknown to what extent they may influence the effectiveness of an individualized multicomponent exercise program offered to hospitalized older adults. Methods This study is a secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial conducted in the Department of Geriatric Medicine of a tertiary hospital. In addition to the standard care, an exercise-training multicomponent program was delivered to the intervention group during the acute hospitalization period. Multimorbidity patterns were determined through fuzzy c-means cluster analysis, over 38 chronic diseases. Functional, cognitive and affective outcomes were considered. Results Three hundred and six patients were included in the analyses (154 control; 152 intervention), with a mean age of 87.2 years, and 58.5% being female. Four patterns of multimorbidity were identified: heart valves and prostate diseases (26.8%); metabolic diseases and colitis (20.6%); psychiatric, cardiovascular and autoimmune diseases (16%); and an unspecific pattern (36.6%). The Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) test improved across all patterns, but the intervention was most effective for patients in the metabolic/colitis pattern (2.48-point difference between intervention/control groups, 95% CI 1.60-3.35). Regarding the Barthel Index and the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), the differences were significant for all multimorbidity patterns, except for the psychiatric/cardio/autoimmune pattern. Differences concerning quality of life were especially high for the p sychiatric/cardio/autoimmune pattern (16.9-point difference between intervention/control groups, 95% CI 4.04, 29.7). Conclusions Patients in all the analyzed multimorbidity patterns improved with this tailored program, but the improvement was highest for those in the metabolic pattern. Understanding how different chronic disease combinations are associated with specific functional and cognitive responses to a multicomponent exercise intervention may allow further tailoring such interventions to older patients\u2019 clinical profile.",

However, due to the risk of autoimmune side effects, their use in people with autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS) has been limited. Objective To characterize outcomes in a cohort of adults with MS who received ICIs. Methods A single-center retrospective review of medical record data was performed for people with MS treated with ICIs. Results Seven people with MS were identified, with a mean (SD) age at ICI use of 55.4 (13.7) years and a mean MS duration of 18.2 (12.2) years. Six were treated for cancer; 1 was treated for PML. After mean (SD) follow-up of 1.76 (2.15) years after ICI, outcomes are: no evidence of disease (2), residual metastatic disease (1), death due to cancer (1), death due to PML (1), and lost to follow-up (2). Notably, 0 out of 7 patients experienced an MS relapse; two out of six had new asymptomatic demyelinating magnetic resonance imaging lesions. In the three patients with expanded disability status scale (EDSS) scores at baseline and follow-up, EDSS remained stable (mean delta 0.13). Conclusion In this cohort, no people with MS experienced clinical relapses and one-third experienced asymptomatic radiological activity following ICI treatment.",

      "title": "Statistical and artificial intelligence techniques to identify risk factors for suicide in children and adolescents",
      "abstract": "Background: Suicidal Behaviors and Thoughts are a relevant public health issue that includes suicidal ideation, non-suicidal self-harm, attempted suicide, and failed suicides. Since there is a progression of suicidal behaviors, whereby suicide is more likely to be completed if there have already been previous behaviors or attempts to harm oneself, WHO has highlighted the need to detect early predictors of such suicidal behaviors, which can help identify individuals at risk, plan prevention strategies and implement specific therapeutic interventions, particularly in young people, thus reducing the number of deaths. This retrospective observational study aimed to identify early predictors of suicidal risk in 237 inpatients admitted for Suicidal Behaviors and Thoughts at Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Emergency Unit of the Meyer Children's Hospital, Florence, Italy. Methods: The study was subdivided into three phases: data collection, statistical analysis, and neural network. For each patient, we collected epidemiological and psychopathological data. We stratified the inpatients into two groups: \u201csuicidal volition patients\u201d and \u201csuicidal motivation patients.\u201d Results: The hospitalization rate for suicidal behaviors and thoughts showed a growing trend from 2016 to 2020 (27.69 to 45.28%). Under 12 years of age, diagnosis of disruptive, impulse-control and conduct disorder, previous specialist care, history of attempted suicide, and intoxication as methods of suicide were statistically correlated to an increased risk of suicidal behaviors. Artificial intelligence, with an accuracy of 86.7%, confirmed these risk factors. Limitations: The most important limitation of the study is its retrospective nature. Conclusions: Our study identifies new early predictors of suicidal risk: age less than 12, diagnosis of disruptive, impulse-control and conduct disorder. In addition, suicidal volition behavior emerges as an important and underestimated risk factor. The use of artificial intelligence methods could be supporting the clinician in assessing suicidal risk.",

      "abstract": "Background Gait and balance impairments are often present in people with multiple sclerosis (PwMS) and have a significant impact on quality of life and independence. Gold-standard quantitative tools for assessing gait and balance such as motion capture systems and force plates usually require complex technical setups. Wearable sensors, including those integrated into smartphones, offer a more frequent, convenient, and minimally burdensome assessment of functional disability in a home environment. We developed a novel smartphone sensor-based application (Floodlight) that is being used in multiple research and clinical contexts, but a complete validation of this technology is still lacking. Methods This protocol describes an observational study designed to evaluate the analytical and clinical validity of Floodlight gait and balance tests. Approximately 100 PwMS and 35 healthy controls will perform multiple gait and balance tasks in both laboratory-based and real-world environments in order to explore the following properties: (a) concurrent validity of the Floodlight gait and balance tests against gold-standard assessments; (b) reliability of Floodlight digital measures derived under different controlled gait and balance conditions, and different on-body sensor locations; (c) ecological validity of the tests; and (d) construct validity compared with clinician- and patient-reported assessments. Conclusions The Floodlight GaitLab study (ISRCTN15993728) represents a critical step in the technical validation of Floodlight technology to measure gait and balance in PwMS, and will also allow the development of new test designs and algorithms.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rare subgroup of pulmonary hypertension (PH). Claims and administrative databases can be particularly important for research in rare diseases; however, there is a lack of validated algorithms to identify PAH patients using administrative codes. We aimed to measure the accuracy of code\u2010based PAH algorithms against the true clinical diagnosis by right heart catheterization (RHC). This study evaluated algorithms in patients who were recorded in two linkable data assets: the Stanford Healthcare administrative electronic health record database and the Stanford Vera Moulton Wall Center clinical PH database (which records each patient's RHC diagnosis). We assessed the sensitivity and specificity achieved by 16 algorithms (six published). In total, 720 PH patients with linked data available were included and 558 (78%) of these were PAH patients. Algorithms consisting solely of a P(A)H\u2010specific diagnostic code classed all or almost all PH patients as PAH (sensitivity &gt;97%, specificity &lt;12%) while multicomponent algorithms with well\u2010defined temporal sequences of procedure, diagnosis and treatment codes achieved a better balance of sensitivity and specificity. Specificity increased and sensitivity decreased with increasing algorithm complexity. The best\u2010performing algorithms, in terms of fewest misclassified patients, included multiple components (e.g., PH diagnosis, PAH treatment, continuous enrollment for \u22656 months before and \u226512 months following index date) and achieved sensitivities and specificities of around 95% and 38%, respectively. Our findings help researchers tailor their choice and design of code\u2010based PAH algorithms to their research question and demonstrate the importance of including well\u2010defined temporal components in the algorithms.",

      "abstract": "Objective Noninvasive telemonitoring aims to improve healthcare for patients with chronic heart failure (HF) by reducing hospitalizations and improving patient experiences. Yet, sustainable adoption seems to be limited. Therefore, the goal of our study is to gain insight in the processes that support sustainable adoption of telemonitoring for patients with HF. Methods We conducted semi-structured interviews with 25 stakeholders that were involved with the adoption of telemonitoring, such as healthcare professionals, policymakers and healthcare insurers. We analyzed the interviews by using a combination of open-coding and the themes of the Non-adoption or Abandonment of technology by individuals and difficulties achieving Scale-up, Spread and Sustainability framework. Results We found that telemonitoring projects have moved beyond initial pilot phases despite a high level of complexity on multiple topics. The patient selection, the business case, the evidence, the aims of telemonitoring, integration of telemonitoring in the care pathway, reimbursement, and future centralization were items that yielded different and sometimes contradictory opinions. Conclusions This study showed that the sustainable adoption of telemonitoring for HF is a complex endeavor. Different aims and perspectives play an important role in the patient selection, design, evaluations and envisioned futures of telemonitoring. High conviction among participants of the added value that telemonitoring may support further adoption of telemonitoring. Structural evaluations will be needed to guide cyclical improvement and adapt programs to employ telemonitoring in such a manner that it contributes to collectively supported aims.",

      "title": "International Systematic Review of Utility Values Associated with Cardiovascular Disease and Reflections on Selecting Evidence for a UK Decision-Analytic Model",
      "abstract": "Purpose Evaluating interventions for cardiovascular disease (CVD) requires estimates of its effect on utility. We aimed to 1) systematically review utility estimates for CVDs published since 2013 and 2) critically appraise UK-relevant estimates and calculate corresponding baseline utility multipliers. Methods We searched MEDLINE and Embase (April 22, 2021) using CVD and utility terms. We screened results for primary studies reporting utility distributions for people with experience of heart failure, myocardial infarction, peripheral arterial disease, stable angina, stroke, transient ischemic attack, or unstable angina. We extracted characteristics from studies included. For UK estimates based on the EuroQoL 5-dimension (EQ-5D) measure, we assessed risk of bias and applicability to a decision-analytic model, pooled arms/time points as appropriate, and estimated baseline utility multipliers using predicted utility for age- and sex- matched populations without CVD. We sought utility sources from directly applicable studies with low risk of bias, prioritizing plausibility of severity ordering in our base-case model and highest population ascertainment in a sensitivity analysis. Results Most of the 403 studies identified used EQ-5D ( n = 217) and most assessed Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development populations ( n = 262), although measures and countries varied widely. UK studies using EQ-5D ( n = 29) produced very heterogeneous baseline utility multipliers for each type of CVD, precluding meta-analysis and implying different possible severity orderings. We could find sources that provided a plausible ordering of utilities while adequately representing health states. Conclusions We cataloged international CVD utility estimates and calculated UK-relevant baseline utility multipliers. Modelers should consider unreported sources of heterogeneity, such as population differences, when selecting utility evidence from reviews. Highlights Published systematic reviews have summarized estimates of utility associated with cardiovascular disease published up to 2013. We 1) reviewed utility estimates for 7 types of cardiovascular disease published since 2013, 2) critically appraised UK-relevant studies, and 3) estimated the effect of each cardiovascular disease on baseline utility. Our review 1) recommends a consistent and reliable set of baseline utility multipliers for 7 types of cardiovascular disease and 2) provides systematically identified reference information for researchers seeking utility evidence for their own context.",

      "title": "Crowdsourcing smartphone data for biomedical research: Ethical and legal questions",
      "abstract": "The use of smartphones has greatly increased in the last decade and has revolutionized the way that health data are being collected and shared. Mobile applications leverage the ubiquity and technological sophistication of modern smartphones to record and process a variety of metrics relevant to human health, including behavioral measures, clinical data, and disease symptoms. Information processed by mobile applications may have significant utility for increasing biomedical knowledge, both through conventional research and emerging discovery paradigms such as citizen science. However, the ways in which smartphone-collected data may be used in nontraditional modes of biomedical discovery are not well understood, such as using data to train artificially intelligent algorithms and for product development purposes. This paper argues that the use of mobile health data for algorithm training and product development is (a) likely to become a prominent fixture in medicine, (b) likely to raise significant ethical and legal challenges, and (c) warrants immediate scrutiny by policymakers and scholars. We introduce the concept of \u201csmartphone-crowdsourced medical data,\u201d or SCMD, and set out a broad research agenda for addressing concerns associated with this new and potentially momentous practice. We conclude that SCMD for algorithm training raises a number of ethical and legal issues which require further scholarly attention to ensure that individual interests are protected and that emerging health information sources can be used in ways that maximally, and safely, promote medical innovation.",

The authors reflected on a digital resource co-created by this study and speculated on future digital adaptations that might address some of the service development needs that children and young people identified. This was inspired by Haraway\u2019s (1985) call to imagine cyborgification in order to break from dominant thinking while being cautious of how power operates in human-machine conjunctures. The imagined digital adaptations focus on connecting to people and places, leisure, education, accommodation, journey planning through care and systems accountability. Imagining cyborgification highlighted how digital adaptations are embedded in, and not a substitute for, trusting relationships. Adaptations must be co-developed by intergenerational groups of children and professionals. Bourdieu\u2019s (1985 , 1986 ) notions of habitus, field and capitals could guide theoretically informed feasibility testing, drawing attention to distributions of resources. Key questions relate to: When can digital adaptations challenge the dominant habits and politics of social care, strengthen deep relationships and secure social, cultural and economic capital in the hands of young experts and their adult allies, so that systems can redress inequalities and promote accountability?",

      "abstract": "Abstract Pulmonary hypertension (PH) associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD) (PH\u2010CKD) affects approximately 20%\u201340% of CKD patients and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. PH and CKD are both pathophysiologically associated with nitric oxide (NO) deficiency. The NO pathway, an important therapeutic domain in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), is an intriguing but unexplored target in PH\u2010CKD. We sought to improve understanding of the clinical significance of the NO pathway in patients with PH\u2010CKD by assessing the hemodynamic response to inhaled NO (iNO) during right heart catheterization (RHC). In this retrospective cohort study, patients with diagnosis codes of PH and stage IV/V CKD or end\u2010stage renal disease and estimated glomerular filtration rate &lt; 60 mL/min/body surface area who underwent RHC and hemodynamic drug study between July 2011 and June 2021 were eligible. Patients with mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP) &gt; 20 mmHg and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) &gt; 3 Wood units were included. The final cohort included 37 patients (45.9% female, mean age 72.5 \u00b1 9.7 years). A total of 56.7% of the cohort (21/37) had precapillary PH, while 43.2% (16/37) had combined precapillary postcapillary PH (Cpc\u2010PH). Median survival was 3.1 years after RHC. iNO was associated with a significant decrease in both mPAP and PVR. Hemodynamic changes in mPAP and PVR were similar in precapillary and Cpc\u2010PH groups. Among a small subset ( n = 14) who were subsequently treated with PAH\u2010targeted therapy, treatment response was mixed and did not reveal significant benefit. Further studies are warranted to better define the potential role of PAH therapy in PH\u2010CKD.",

      "abstract": "Objective To explore the technology-based tools available for supporting the identification of victims of domestic abuse and modern slavery in remote services and consider the benefits and challenges posed by the existing tools. Methods We searched six academic databases. Studies were considered for inclusion if they were published in English between 2000 and 2023. The QuADS quality appraisal tool was used to assess the methodological quality of included studies. A narrative synthesis was conducted using the convergent integrated approach. Results Twenty-four studies were included, of which two were professional guidelines; each reported on a distinct technology-based tool for remote services. All tools related to domestic abuse and 21 focused on screening for intimate partner violence among young and mid-life women (18\u201365) in high-income countries. The review did not identify tools that support the identification of victims of modern slavery. We identified eight common themes of tool strengths, highlighting that the remote approach to screening was practical, acceptable to victims, and, in some circumstances, elicited better outcomes than face-to-face approaches. Five themes pointed to tool challenges, such as concerns around privacy and safety, and the inability of computerised tools to provide empathy and emotional support. Conclusions Available technology-based tools may support the identification of victims of domestic abuse by health and social care practitioners in remote services. However, it is important to be mindful of the limitations of such tools and the effects individuals\u2019 screening preferences can have on outcomes. Future research should focus on developing tools to support the identification of victims of modern slavery, as well as empirically validating tools for screening during remote consultations.",

Four key themes emerged from the data: (1) realising person-centred prerequisites which have two sub-themes \u2013 curriculum and reality of practice, (2) challenge of high-acuity calls, (3) developing a rapport with vulnerable people and, (4) factors in the macro environment. Conclusion Paramedic students witnessed moments of person-centred practice and were enabled to reflect on their learning experiences in positive ways, by working with paramedics/practice educators. However, their person-centred ideals were constantly challenged as students negotiated to work in complex, dynamic situations and in a health system under pressure.",

      "abstract": "Objective: To investigate mothers\u2019 experiences in raising a child with suspected high functioning autism or Asperger\u2019s syndrome while trying to get a diagnosis for their child, specifically focusing on stress and health-related quality of life. Mothers who already have a diagnosis for their child acted as a comparison group. &#13;\\n&#13;\\nMethod: A cross-sectional mixed methods approach was applied. The Parenting Stress Index Short Form (PSI/SF), the 12 Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF12) and a demographic questionnaire was administered to a convenience sample of 40 mothers in the experimental group and 44 in the comparison group, all of whom resided in the UK. Qualitative semi-structured interviews with a sample of 4 mothers in each group followed to expand on those findings; data was analysed using thematic analysis. &#13;\\n&#13;\\nResults: Although both groups displayed clinically high mean scores for all the PSI/SF subscales and overall stress, the experimental group displayed significantly higher scores in the Parenting Stress and Difficult Child subscales and overall stress scores. The experimental group scored significantly worse in the Mental Component Summary scores of the Health Survey than the comparison group, indicating poorer mental-health related quality of life. The interviews, which discussed mother\u2019s experiences of raising their child, the diagnostic process and its implications, also supported the quantitative findings.&#13;\\n&#13;\\nImplications: This study highlights the health and mental health implications on the large population of mothers seeking diagnoses of autism for their children. This population group is largely neglected in the literature. This brings into focus areas where further in-depth research and development of support systems for this population would potentially benefit these parents, specifically in terms of health related quality of life and it supports the drive by the National Autistic Society for earlier diagnoses and more efficient diagnostic processes.",

      "title": "Harnessing Artificial Intelligence to Meet Global Healthcare Challenges: Reparative Algorithmic Impact Assessments in Context",
      "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has the ability to revolutionize global healthcare delivery, offering opportunities to accelerate progress toward Sustainable Development Goal 3: Good Health and Well-being. This potential is especially significant in the Global South, where resource constraints, infrastructure limitations, and diverse sociocultural approaches to health and healing create complex, or \u201cwicked,\u201d problems. From clinical decision support systems and diagnostic tools to predictive analytics and drug discovery platforms, AI applications are multifold. However, their rapid deployment raises ethical concerns, particularly regarding their potential to perpetuate harm. Current governance mechanisms often fall short in addressing structural inequities or empowering affected communities. These frameworks typically focus narrowly on risk identification/mitigation and technical fairness, neglecting crucial historical and sociocultural realities. This article introduces Reparative Algorithmic Impact Assessments (R-AIAs) as a transformative framework for ensuring ethical and equitable AI deployment in healthcare. Grounded in decolonial and intersectional values, R-AIAs emphasize challenging Western epistemologies, promoting data inclusivity and sovereignty, fostering participatory governance, and redressing systemic biases, inequities, and power imbalances. The framework's ability to center diverse knowledge systems, such as Ubuntu philosophy, emphasizes its catalytic potential. R-AIAs operationalize these principles through six interconnected steps, exemplified by a case study of an AI-powered maternal health system in sub-Saharan Africa. These steps offer actionable strategies for bridging global divides. By embedding reparative practices, R-AIAs elevate impact assessments from compliance exercises to tools for empowerment, challenging colonial legacies and advancing global health equity. The framework underscores that achieving \u201cAI for All\u201d demands a sustained commitment to justice and redress.",

      "abstract": "Background The rapid integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into healthcare has transformed how health professionals learn, communicate, and make clinical decisions. However, AI-generated images and digital outputs often reproduce societal stereotypes, particularly regarding gender and race. Aim This study examined how nursing students\u2019 perceptions of gender, race, and professional roles are shaped by AI-generated images of healthcare professionals, and how these perceptions influence their communication styles and ethical awareness in interactions with AI. Design A multimethod, cross-sectional design integrating quantitative and qualitative approaches was used. Quantitative data assessed gender attitudes in the nursing profession, while qualitative data explored visual interpretations and language patterns in AI interactions. Participant Population The sample included 132 second- and fourth-year nursing students from a health sciences faculty in T\u00fcrkiye. Ethical Consideration The study was approved by the institutional ethics committee. Findings Results indicated that nursing students largely relied on visual cues particularly clothing and posture when identifying professional roles in AI-generated images. Despite claiming objectivity, students frequently associated doctors with men and nurses with women, reflecting persistent gender schemas. Female participants demonstrated greater sensitivity to both gender and racial imbalances, whereas males perceived AI-generated visuals as more neutral. Language analysis revealed two main communication styles in chatbot interactions: polite and direct. Quantitative findings showed that being female, having lower income, and higher GPA were associated with more egalitarian attitudes. Conclusion Nursing students\u2019 perceptions and interactions with AI are influenced by implicit gender and racial stereotypes embedded in visual and linguistic representations. Integrating AI ethics, gender equity, and digital literacy into nursing curricula will foster critical awareness, algorithmic fairness, and equitable professional identity formation among future nurses.",

Objectives Our study has 2 goals: (i) to clarify key themes in degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM) research, and (ii) to evaluate the current trends in the popularity or decline of these topics. Additionally, we aim to highlight the potential of natural language processing (NLP) in facilitating research syntheses. Methods Documents were retrieved from Scopus, preprocessed, and modeled using BERTopic, an NLP-based topic modeling method. We specified a minimum topic size of 25 documents and 50 words per topic. After the models were trained, they generated a list of topics and corresponding representative documents. We utilized linear regression models to examine trends within the identified topics. In this context, topics exhibiting increasing linear slopes were categorized as \u201chot topics,\u201d while those with decreasing slopes were categorized as \u201ccold topics\u201d. Results Our analysis retrieved 3510 documents that were classified into 21 different topics. The 3 most frequently occurring topics were \u201cOPLL\u201d (ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament), \u201cAnterior Fusion,\u201d and \u201cSurgical Outcomes.\u201d Trend analysis revealed the hottest topics of the decade to be \u201cAnimal Models,\u201d \u201cDCM in the Elderly,\u201d and \u201cPosterior Decompression\u201d while \u201cMorphometric Analyses,\u201d \u201cQuestionnaires,\u201d and \u201cMEP and SSEP\u201d were identified as being the coldest topics. Conclusions Our NLP methodology conducted a thorough and detailed analysis of DCM research, uncovering valuable insights into research trends that were otherwise difficult to discern using traditional techniques. The results provide valuable guidance for future research directions, policy considerations, and identification of emerging trends.",

      "abstract": "Understanding patient experience in healthcare is increasingly important and desired by medical professionals in a patient-centred care approach. Healthcare discourse on social media presents an opportunity to gain a unique perspective on patient-reported experiences, complementing traditional survey data. These social media reports often appear as first-hand accounts of patients\u2019 journeys through the healthcare system, whose details extend beyond the confines of structured surveys and at a far larger scale than focus groups. However, in contrast with the vast presence of patient-experience data on social media and the potential benefits the data offers, it attracts comparatively little research attention due to the technical proficiency required for text analysis. In this article, we introduce the design-acquire-process-model-analyse-visualise framework to provide an overview of techniques and an approach to capture patient-reported experiences from social media data. We apply this framework in a case study on prostate cancer data from /r/ProstateCancer, demonstrate the framework\u2019s value in capturing specific aspects of patient concern (such as sexual dysfunction), provide an overview of the discourse, and show narrative and emotional progression through these stories. We anticipate this framework to apply to a wide variety of areas in healthcare, including capturing and differentiating experiences across minority groups, geographic boundaries, and types of illnesses.",

This study examines the development of platform co-ops to gain insight into the reasons and mechanisms behind their slow but steady growth in Europe. Using desk research on 48 platform co-ops and 16 in-depth interviews with founders of platform co-ops, we build on paradox theorizing to analyze how founders of platform co-ops manage competing demands during the start-up phase. Extending recent studies on interorganizational paradoxes, we show how systemic tensions in the gig economy motivate the creation of platform co-ops as a way of coping and that interactions between tensions on different levels during actual development can result in failed market entry. Hence, this study also addresses the counter-intuitiveness to the establishment of organizations permeated with paradoxical tensions.",

      "abstract": "Funnel plots are a visual tool for investigating publication and other bias in meta-analysis. They are simple scatterplots of the treatment effects estimated from individual studies (horizontal axis) against a measure of study size (vertical axis). The name \u201cfunnel plot\u201d is based on the precision in the estimation of the underlying treatment effect increasing as the sample size of component studies increases. Therefore, in the absence of bias, results from small studies will scatter widely at the bottom of the graph, with the spread narrowing among larger studies. Publication bias (the association of publication probability with the statistical significance of study results) may lead to asymmetrical funnel plots. It is, however, important to realize that publication bias is only one of a number of possible causes of funnel-plot asymmetry-funnel plots should be seen as a generic means of examining small study effects (the tendency for the smaller studies in a meta-analysis to show larger treatment effects) rather than a tool to diagnose specific types of bias. This article introduces the metafunnel command, which produces funnel plots in Stata. In accordance with published recommendations, standard error is used as the measure of study size. Treatment effects expressed as ratio measures (for example risk ratios or odds ratios) may be plotted on a log scale.",

      "abstract": "Binary logistic regression is one of the most frequently applied statistical approaches for developing clinical prediction models. Developers of such models often rely on an Events Per Variable criterion (EPV), notably EPV \u226510, to determine the minimal sample size required and the maximum number of candidate predictors that can be examined. We present an extensive simulation study in which we studied the influence of EPV, events fraction, number of candidate predictors, the correlations and distributions of candidate predictor variables, area under the ROC curve, and predictor effects on out-of-sample predictive performance of prediction models. The out-of-sample performance (calibration, discrimination and probability prediction error) of developed prediction models was studied before and after regression shrinkage and variable selection. The results indicate that EPV does not have a strong relation with metrics of predictive performance, and is not an appropriate criterion for (binary) prediction model development studies. We show that out-of-sample predictive performance can better be approximated by considering the number of predictors, the total sample size and the events fraction. We propose that the development of new sample size criteria for prediction models should be based on these three parameters, and provide suggestions for improving sample size determination.",

      "abstract": "Between 1990 and 2012, the global mean age at diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder ranged from 38 to 120 months. Measures have since been introduced to reduce the age at autism spectrum disorder diagnosis, but the current global mean age is unknown. This review and meta-analysis report the average age at diagnosis from studies published between 2012 and 2019. We initially identified 1150 articles, including 56 studies that reported the mean or median age at diagnosis across 40 countries (n = 120,540 individuals with autism spectrum disorder). Meta-analysis results (on 35 studies, including 55 cohorts from 35 countries, n = 66,966 individuals with autism spectrum disorder) found a current mean age at diagnosis of 60.48 months (range: 30.90\u2013234.57 months). The subgroup analysis for studies that only included children aged \u2a7d10 years (nine studies, including 26 cohorts from 23 countries, n = 18,134 children with autism spectrum disorder) showed a mean age at diagnosis of 43.18 months (range: 30.90\u201374.70 months). Numerous factors may influence age at diagnosis and were reported by 46 studies, often with conflicting or inconclusive findings. Our study is the first to ascertain the global average age at autism spectrum disorder diagnosis from a meta-analysis. Continued efforts to lower the average age at autism spectrum disorder diagnosis are needed. Lay abstract We currently assume that the global mean age at diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder ranges from 38 to 120 months. However, this range is based on studies from 1991 to 2012 and measures have since been introduced to reduce the age at autism spectrum disorder diagnosis. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis (statistical analysis that combines the results of multiple scientific studies) for studies published between 2012 and 2019 to evaluate the current age at autism spectrum disorder diagnosis. We included 56 studies that reported the age at diagnosis for 40 countries (containing 120,540 individuals with autism spectrum disorder). Results showed the current mean age at diagnosis to be 60.48 months (range: 30.90\u2013234.57 months) and 43.18 months (range: 30.90\u201374.70 months) for studies that only included children aged \u2a7d10 years. Numerous factors that may influence age at diagnosis (e.g. type of autism spectrum disorder diagnosis, additional diagnoses and gender) were reported by 46 studies, often with conflicting or inconclusive results. Our study is the first to determine the global average age at autism spectrum disorder diagnosis from a meta-analysis.

      "abstract": "Background. Visual displays are often used to communicate important medical information to patients. However, even the simplest graphs are not understood by everyone. Objective. To develop and test a scale to measure health-related graph literacy and investigate the level of graph literacy in the United States and Germany. Design. Experimental and questionnaire studies. Setting. Computerized studies in the laboratory and on probabilistic national samples in the United States and Germany. Participants. Nationally representative samples of people 25 to 69 years of age in Germany ( n = 495) and the United States ( n = 492). Laboratory pretest on 60 younger and 60 older people. Measurements. Psychometric properties of the scale (i.e., reliability, validity, discriminability) and level of graph literacy in the two countries. Results. The new graph literacy scale predicted which patients can benefit from visual aids and had promising measurement properties. Participants in both countries completed approximately 9 of 13 items correctly (in Germany, x\u00af = 9.4, s = 2.6; in the United States, x\u00af = 9.3, s = 2.9). Approximately one third of the population in both countries had both low graph literacy and low numeracy skills. Limitations. The authors focused on basic graph literacy only. They used a computerized scale; comparability with paper-and-pencil versions should be checked. Conclusions. The new graph literacy scale seems to be a suitable tool for assessing whether patients understand common graphical formats and shows that not everyone profits from standard visual displays. Research is needed on communication formats that can overcome the barriers of both low numeracy and graph literacy.",

      "title": "Beyond Risk and Protective Factors: An Adaptation-Based Approach to Resilience",
      "abstract": "How does repeated or chronic childhood adversity shape social and cognitive abilities? According to the prevailing deficit model, children from high-stress backgrounds are at risk for impairments in learning and behavior, and the intervention goal is to prevent, reduce, or repair the damage. Missing from this deficit approach is an attempt to leverage the unique strengths and abilities that develop in response to high-stress environments. Evolutionary-developmental models emphasize the coherent, functional changes that occur in response to stress over the life course. Research in birds, rodents, and humans suggests that developmental exposures to stress can improve forms of attention, perception, learning, memory, and problem solving that are ecologically relevant in harsh-unpredictable environments (as per the specialization hypothesis). Many of these skills and abilities, moreover, are primarily manifest in currently stressful contexts where they would provide the greatest fitness-relevant advantages (as per the sensitization hypothesis). This perspective supports an alternative adaptation-based approach to resilience that converges on a central question: \u201cWhat are the attention, learning, memory, problem-solving, and decision-making strategies that are enhanced through exposures to childhood adversity?\u201d At an applied level, this approach focuses on how we can work with, rather than against, these strengths to promote success in education, employment, and civic life.",

      "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) and digital health (DH) solutions are reshaping musculoskeletal (MSK) care across diagnostics, treatment planning, workflow optimization, and administrative burden reduction. AI-enabled triage systems enhance patient flow efficiency, while automated scheduling, symptom checkers, and AI-powered virtual assistants streamline pre-visit interactions. In MSK radiographic diagnostics, AI augments imaging interpretation, enabling automated fracture detection, opportunistic screening, and quantitative imaging, improving diagnostic accuracy and standardization. Preoperative planning solutions facilitate implant templating, surgical navigation, and patient-specific instrumentation, reducing variability and enhancing surgical precision. Concurrently, digital scribes and AI-driven documentation tools alleviate administrative overhead, mitigating clinician burnout and enabling refocused patient engagement. Predictive analytics optimize treatment pathways by leveraging multimodal patient data for risk stratification and personalized decision support. However, algorithmic bias, model generalizability, regulatory hurdles, and legal ambiguities present substantial implementation barriers, necessitating rigorous validation, adaptive governance, and seamless clinical integration. The U.S. and EU regulatory landscapes diverge in their approaches to AI oversight, with the former favoring expedited market access and the latter imposing stringent compliance mandates under the EU AI Act. AI\u2019s integration into MSK care demands robust validation frameworks, standardized interoperability protocols, and dynamic regulatory pathways balancing safety and innovation. Emerging generalist foundation models, open-source large language models (LLMs), and specialized AI-driven medical applications herald a paradigm shift toward precision MSK care. These innovations will require prospective clinical validation to ensure patient benefit and mitigate risk. Addressing ethical considerations, ensuring equitable access, and fostering interdisciplinary collaboration remain paramount in translating AI\u2019s potential into tangible improvements in MSK healthcare delivery.",

      "abstract": "The greater power of bad events over good ones is found in everyday events, major life events (e.g., trauma), close relationship outcomes, social network patterns, interpersonal interactions, and learning processes. Bad emotions, bad parents, and bad feedback have more impact than good ones, and bad information is processed more thoroughly than good. The self is more motivated to avoid bad self-definitions than to pursue good ones. Bad impressions and bad stereotypes are quicker to form and more resistant to disconfirmation than good ones. Various explanations such as diagnosticity and salience help explain some findings, but the greater power of bad events is still found when such variables are controlled. Hardly any exceptions (indicating greater power of good) can be found. Taken together, these findings suggest that bad is stronger than good, as a general principle across a broad range of psychological phenomena.",

      "abstract": "Aim: Pharyngodynia, nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, smell, and taste dysfunctions could be the presenting symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. The aim was to perform a systematic review of current evidences on clinical presentation of COVID-19, focusing on upper airway symptoms in order to help otolaryngologists identifying suspected cases. Methods: We searched PubMed and Web of Science electronic databases. Results: We included 5 retrospective clinical studies for a total of 1556 hospitalized patients with COVID-19, 57.5% were male and mean age was 49.1 years. Pooled data revealed that pharyngodynia was present in 12.4% of patients, nasal congestion in 3.7%, and rhinorrhea was rare. No reports on COVID-19 and olfactory/gustative disorders matched inclusion criteria but preliminary evidences suggested they could be present. Common symptoms were fever (85.6%), cough (68.7%), and fatigue (39.4%). Frequent comorbidities were hypertension (17.4%), diabetes (3.8%), and coronary heart disease (3.8%); 83% of patients had alterations on chest computed tomography that were bilateral in 89.5% of cases. Ground-glass opacity was the most common finding (50%). Lymphopenia (77.2%) and leucopenia (30.1%) were common. Critical cases with complications were 9%, intensive care unit admission was required in 7.3%, invasive ventilation in 3.4%, and mortality was 2.4%. Conclusion: Otolaryngologists should know that pharyngodynia, nasal congestion, olfactory, and gustative disorders could be the presenting symptoms of COVID-19. Clinical presentation together with radiological and laboratory findings could help to identify suspected cases.",

      "abstract": "Background: Injury and illness surveillance, and epidemiological studies, are fundamental elements of concerted efforts to protect the health of the athlete. To encourage consistency in the definitions and methodology used, and to enable data across studies to be compared, research groups have published 11 sport- or setting-specific consensus statements on sports injury (and, eventually, illnesses) epidemiology to date. Objective: To further strengthen consistency in data collection, injury definitions, and research reporting through an updated set of recommendations for sports injury and illness studies, including a new Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) checklist extension. Study Design: Consensus statement of the International Olympic Committee (IOC). Methods: The IOC invited a working group of international experts to review relevant literature and provide recommendations. The procedure included an open online survey, several stages of text drafting and consultation by working groups, and a 3-day consensus meeting in October 2019. Results: This statement includes recommendations for data collection and research reporting covering key components: defining and classifying health problems, severity of health problems, capturing and reporting athlete exposure, expressing risk, burden of health problems, study population characteristics, and data collection methods. Based on these, we also developed a new reporting guideline as a STROBE extension\u2014the STROBE Sports Injury and Illness Surveillance (STROBE-SIIS). Conclusion: The IOC encourages ongoing in- and out-of-competition surveillance programs and studies to describe injury and illness trends and patterns, understand their causes, and develop measures to protect the health of the athlete. The implementation of the methods outlined in this statement will advance consistency in data collection and research reporting.",

      "abstract": "We present a meta-analysis of studies that compare figurative language comprehension in individuals with autism spectrum disorder and in typically developing controls who were matched based on chronological age or/and language ability. A total of 41 studies and 45 independent effect sizes were included based on predetermined inclusion criteria. Group matching strategy, age, types of figurative language, and cross-linguistic differences were examined as predictors that might explain heterogeneity in effect sizes. Overall, individuals with autism spectrum disorder showed poorer comprehension of figurative language than their typically developing peers (Hedges\u2019 g = \u20130.57). A meta-regression analysis showed that group matching strategy and types of figurative language were significantly related to differences in effect sizes, whereas chronological age and cross-linguistic differences were not. Differences between the autism spectrum disorder and typically developing groups were small and nonsignificant when the groups were matched based on the language ability. Metaphors were more difficult to comprehend for individuals with autism spectrum disorder compared with typically developing controls than were irony and sarcasm. Our findings highlight the critical role of core language skills in figurative language comprehension. Interventions and educational programmes designed to improve social communication skills in individuals with autism spectrum disorder may beneficially target core language skills in addition to social skills.",

However, it could also be a catalyst for a necessary societal transformation to a sustainable and healthy future. Doctors have a crucial role in climate change mitigation and health system adaptation to prepare for emergent health threats and a carbon-constrained future. This paper argues that climate change should be integrated into medical education for three reasons: first, to prepare students for clinical practice in a climate-changing world; secondly, to promote public health and eco-health literacy; and finally, to deepen existing learning and strengthen graduate attributes. This paper builds on existing literature and the authors\u2019 experience to outline potential learning objectives, teaching methods and assessment tasks. In the wake of recent progress at the United Nations climate change conference, COP-21, it is hoped that this paper will assist universities to integrate teaching about climate change into medical education.",

Database searches of Medline, CINAHL, PsychINFO, Scopus, ERIC, Web of Science and EMBASE were conducted. Studies describing adults with autism spectrum disorder employed in competitive, supported or sheltered employment were included. Content analysis was used to identify the strengths and abilities in the workplace of employees with autism spectrum disorder. Finally, meaningful concepts relating to employment interventions were extracted and linked to the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health Core Sets for autism spectrum disorder. The search identified 134 studies for inclusion with methodological quality ranging from limited to strong. Of these studies, only 36 evaluated employment interventions that were coded and linked to the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health, primarily focusing on modifying autism spectrum disorder characteristics for improved job performance, with little consideration of the impact of contextual factors on work participation. The International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health Core Sets for autism spectrum disorder are a useful tool in holistically examining the employment literature for individuals with autism spectrum disorder. This review highlighted the key role that environmental factors play as barriers and facilitators in the employment of people with autism spectrum disorder and the critical need for interventions which target contextual factors if employment outcomes are to be improved.",

      "title": "The Rooting of the Mind in the Body: New Links Between Attachment Theory and Psychoanalytic Thought",
      "abstract": "The relationship between psychoanalysis and attachment theory is complex indeed. A brief review of the psychoanalytic literature as it concerns attachment theory and research, and of the attachment literature as it pertains to psychoanalytic ideas, demonstrates an increasing interest in attachment theory within psychoanalysis. Some of the difficulties that attachment theory faces in relation to psychoanalytic ideas are traced to its links to the now dated cognitive science of the 1960s and 1970s. Today, however, a second-generation cognitive neuroscience seeks neurobiologically plausible accounts in which links with brain and body are seen as shaping mind and consciousness, which increasingly are seen as \u201cembodied,\u201d as emerging from or serving the needs of a physical being located in a specific time, place, and social context. This idea has also been at the core of much psychoanalytic thinking, which has historically affirmed the rootedness of symbolic thought in sensory, emotional, and enacted experience with objects. Now neurobiological advances supporting the concept of embodied cognition offer an opportunity to forge powerful links between the hitherto separate domains of attachment theory and psychoanalysis. Speculations about the nature of language are presented that emphasize the origin of internal working models (and of representations in general) in early sensorimotor and emotional experiences with a caregiver. It is argued that language and symbolic thought may be phylogenetically and ontogenetically embodied, built on a foundation of gestures and actions, and are thus profoundly influenced by the experience of early physical interaction with the primary object. Finally, the clinical and research implications of these ideas are discussed.",

      "abstract": "The concept of saturation in qualitative research is a widely debated topic. Saturation refers to the point at which no new data or themes are emerging from the data set, which indicates that the data have been fully explored. It is considered an important concept as it helps to ensure that the findings are robust and that the data are being used to their full potential to achieve the research aim. Saturation, or the point at which further observation of data will not lead to the discovery of more information related to the research questions, is an important aspect of qualitative research. However, there is some mystification and semantic debate surrounding the term saturation, and it is not always clear how many rounds of research are needed to reach saturation or what criteria are used to make that determination during the thematic analysis process. This paper focuses on the actualisation of saturation in the context of thematic analysis and develops a systematic approach to using data to justify the contribution of research. Consequently, we introduce a distinct model to help researchers reach saturation through refining or expanding existing quotations, codes, themes and concepts as necessary.",

      "abstract": "The representation of organizational agency in UK policy discourse on public service modernization is analysed in order to disclose the legitimation of elite organizational centres and the structuring of organizational peripheries and their potential for resistance. Three discourses are identified and explored: the residual, but still potent, discourse of professionalism; the dominant discourse of managerialism; and the emergent discourse of leaderism. The emergent discourse of leaderism is shown to be linked to an imaginary of neo-bureaucratic organizing, which represents an evolution of New Public Management. As such, the analysis of leaderism, a new form of privileged agency, contributes an insight into the dynamics of public service modernization. This is developed through exploring leaderism\u2019s tension between its strong affinity with unitarist managerialism and its weaker linkages to quasi-pluralist stakeholder networks which create potentialities for new forms of active resistance.",

      "title": "Investigating the use of data-driven artificial intelligence in computerised decision support systems for health and social care: A systematic review",
      "abstract": "There is growing interest in the potential of artificial intelligence to support decision-making in health and social care settings. There is, however, currently limited evidence of the effectiveness of these systems. The aim of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of artificial intelligence-based computerised decision support systems in health and social care settings. We conducted a systematic literature review to identify relevant randomised controlled trials conducted between 2013 and 2018. We searched the following databases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, ASSIA, Emerald, Health Business Fulltext Elite, ProQuest Public Health, Social Care Online, and grey literature sources. Search terms were conceptualised into three groups: artificial intelligence-related terms, computerised decision support -related terms, and terms relating to health and social care. Terms within groups were combined using the Boolean operator OR, and groups were combined using the Boolean operator AND. Two reviewers independently screened studies against the eligibility criteria and two independent reviewers extracted data on eligible studies onto a customised sheet. We assessed the quality of studies through the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme checklist for randomised controlled trials. We then conducted a narrative synthesis. We identified 68 hits of which five studies satisfied the inclusion criteria. These studies varied substantially in relation to quality, settings, outcomes, and technologies. None of the studies was conducted in social care settings, and three randomised controlled trials showed no difference in patient outcomes. Of these, one investigated the use of Bayesian triage algorithms on forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and health-related quality of life in lung transplant patients. Another investigated the effect of image pattern recognition on neonatal development outcomes in pregnant women, and another investigated the effect of the Kalman filter technique for warfarin dosing suggestions on time in therapeutic range. The remaining two randomised controlled trials, investigating computer vision and neural networks on medication adherence and the impact of learning algorithms on assessment time of patients with gestational diabetes, showed statistically significant and clinically important differences to the control groups receiving standard care. However, these studies tended to be of low quality lacking detailed descriptions of methods and only one study used a double-blind design. Although the evidence of effectiveness of data-driven artificial intelligence to support decision-making in health and social care settings is limited, this work provides important insights on how a meaningful evidence base in this emerging field needs to be developed going forward. It is unlikely that any single overall message surrounding effectiveness will emerge - rather effectiveness of interventions is likely to be context-specific and calls for inclusion of a range of study designs to investigate mechanisms of action.",

In such work, gender contrasts are critical. Because of their position in reproduction and marital patterns, women in sub-Saharan Africa have tended to use lineal strategies, focused on children and grandchildren, in contrast to the more lateral, partner-oriented strategies followed by men. Migration into urban areas and the AIDS pandemic have left many older women in charge of grandchildren in rural areas with inadequate resources and infrastructure. Shaped by traditional values, norms, and roles in their early lives, they currently find many expectations unmet. Indeed, some of the traditional norms that ensured respect, support, reciprocity, and embeddedness may now leave many older people, especially women, isolated, weakened, and victims of illness and violence.",

In this preregistered meta-analysis, we summarize the available evidence on personality change in response to life events using data from 44 studies, including 89 samples with a total of 121,187 participants. Results supported reliable and specific albeit relatively small effects of life events on personality change. Effects were larger and more consistent in the work than in the love domain, with graduation, the first job, a new relationship, marriage, and divorce showing the strongest effects on change in personality variables. Estimates were largely comparable across samples with and without comparison groups. Finally, moderator analyses indicated significant effects of time lag on the links between life events in the love domain and personality change but no effects of other examined variables. We discuss these results in the context of a field-wide turn towards designs that go beyond the study of single life events to examine the mechanisms of personality change using more sophisticated and sensitive designs.",

      "abstract": "Gulf War Syndrome: Is It a Real Disease? asks a recent headline in the New York Times. This questionare certain diseases real?lies at the heart of a simmering controversy in the United States, a debate that has raged, in different contexts, for centuries. In the early nineteenth century, the air of European cities, polluted by open sewers and industrial waste, was generally thought to be the source of infection and disease. Thus the term miasmaliterally deathlike aircame into popular use, only to be later dismissed as medically unsound by Louis Pasteur. While controversy has long swirled in the United States around such illnesses as chronic fatigue syndrome and Epstein-Barr virus, no disorder has been more aggressively contested than environmental illness, a disease whose symptoms are distinguished by an extreme, debilitating reaction to a seemingly ordinary environment. The environmentally ill range from those who have adverse reactions to strong perfumes or colognes to others who are so sensitive to chemicals of any kind that they must retreat entirely from the modern world. Bodies in Protest does not seek to answer the question of whether or not chemical sensitivity is physiological or psychological, rather, it reveals how ordinary people borrow the expert language of medicine to construct lay accounts of their misery. The environmentally ill are not only explaining their bodies to themselves, however, they are also influencing public policies and laws to accommodate the existence of these mysterious illnesses. They have created literally a new body that professional medicine refuses to acknowledge and one that is becoming a popular model for rethinking conventional boundaries between the safe and the dangerous. Having interviewed dozens of the environmentally ill, the authors here recount how these people come to acknowledge and define their disease, and themselves, in a suddenly unlivable world that often stigmatizes them as psychologically unstable. Bodies in Protest is the dramatic story of human bodies that no longer behave in a manner modern medicine can predict and control.",

      "abstract": "The International Commission on Radiological Protection has recently published a report (ICRP Publication 147; Ann. ICRP 50 , 2021) on the use of dose quantities in radiological protection, under the same authorship as this Memorandum. Here, we present a brief summary of the main elements of the report. ICRP Publication 147 consolidates and clarifies the explanations provided in the 2007 ICRP Recommendations (Publication 103) but reaches conclusions that go beyond those presented in Publication 103. Further guidance is provided on the scientific basis for the control of radiation risks using dose quantities in occupational, public and medical applications. It is emphasised that best estimates of risk to individuals will use organ/tissue absorbed doses, appropriate relative biological effectiveness factors and dose\u2013risk models for specific health effects. However, bearing in mind uncertainties including those associated with risk projection to low doses or low dose rates, it is concluded that in the context of radiological protection, effective dose may be considered as an approximate indicator of possible risk of stochastic health effects following low-level exposure to ionising radiation. In this respect, it should also be recognised that lifetime cancer risks vary with age at exposure, sex and population group. The ICRP report also concludes that equivalent dose is not needed as a protection quantity. Dose limits for the avoidance of tissue reactions for the skin, hands and feet, and lens of the eye will be more appropriately set in terms of absorbed dose rather than equivalent dose.",

Methods Systematic literature searches of major databases (1980\u20132016) to identify published evidence of PROM measurement and practical properties. Data on study quality (COSMIN), measurement and practical properties per measure were extracted and assessed against accepted standards to inform an evidence synthesis. Results From 10,903 reviewed abstracts, 103 articles were assessed in full; 46 provided evidence for 23 PROMs: Eleven specific to the health-related impact of migraine (n = 5) or headache (n = 6); six assessed migraine-specific treatment response/satisfaction; six were generic measures. Evidence for measurement validity and score interpretation was strongest for two measures of impact, Migraine-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire (MSQ v2.1) and Headache Impact Test 6-item (HIT-6), and one of treatment response, the Patient Perception of Migraine Questionnaire (PPMQ-R). Evidence of reliability was limited, but acceptable for the HIT-6. Responsiveness was rarely evaluated. Evidence for the remaining measures was limited. Patient involvement was limited and poorly reported. Conclusion While evidence is limited, three measures have acceptable evidence of reliability and validity: HIT-6, MSQ v2.1 and PPMQ-R.

      "abstract": "Objective. There is compelling evidence showing that health literacy influences health outcomes. However, there is a dearth of research investigating this issue in the vast literature on numeracy\u2014the ability to accurately interpret numerical information about risk, a skill that is only moderately correlated with health literacy. In a cross-sectional study, we investigated whether objective and subjective numeracy is related to objective and subjective health outcomes. Objective (subjective) numeracy is actual (self-reported) numerical competence. Objective outcomes include prevalence of comorbidity and prescribed medications. Subjective outcomes include perceptions of physical and mental health. Methods. A convenience sample of 502 male individuals receiving outpatient care at a Veterans Affairs Medical Center reported their demographics and answered a survey measuring objective and subjective numeracy, trust in physicians, satisfaction with role in medical decision making, perceptions of physical and mental health, and risky habits. We computed patients\u2019 body mass index (BMI) and their age-adjusted Charlson index\u2014an extensively studied comorbidity index for predicting mortality in clinical research. We retrieved number of prescribed medications from medical records. Results. Compared with patients who had high objective numeracy, patients with low objective numeracy showed higher prevalence of comorbidities and took more prescribed medications. Compared with patients who had high subjective numeracy, patients with low subjective numeracy had more negative perceptions of their physical and mental health. These conclusions held after controlling for the effect of demographics, risky habits, BMI, trust in physicians, and satisfaction with role in decision making, suggesting that numeracy has a unique, significant contribution to health outcomes beyond the effect of these factors. Conclusions. Our research documents for the first time that self-reported numeracy is related to perceptions of health, whereas objective numeracy is related to actual health, laying the groundwork for future research on the effect of numeracy on health outcomes.",

Design Individual interviews and focus groups. Setting United Kingdom. Participants Non-UK-qualified doctors who had registered with the GMC between 1 April 2006 and 31 March 2008, doctors attending training/induction programmes for non-UK-qualified doctors, and key informants involved in training and support for non-UK-qualified doctors. Main outcome measures Themes identified from analysis of interview and focus group transcripts. Results Information and support for non-UK qualified doctors who apply to register to work in the UK has little reference to the ethical and professional standards required of doctors working in the UK. Recognition of the ethical, legal and cultural context of UK healthcare occurs once doctors are working in practice. Non-UK qualified doctors reported clear differences in the ethical and legal framework for practising medicine between the UK and their country of qualification, particularly in the model of the doctor\u2013patient relationship. The degree of support for non-UK-qualified doctors in dealing with ethical concerns is related to the type of post they work in. European doctors describe similar difficulties with working in an unfamiliar regulatory framework to their non-European colleagues. Conclusions Non-UK-qualified doctors experience a number of difficulties related to practising within a different ethical and professional regulatory framework. Provision of information and educational resources before registration, together with in-practice support would help to develop a more effective understanding of GMP and its implications for practice in the UK.",

      "abstract": "Objective: To determine the types and effectiveness of interventions to increase the knowledge about, attitudes towards, and use of standardized outcome measures in rehabilitation professionals. Data sources: An electronic search using Medline, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Ergonomics Abstracts, Sports Discus. The search is current to February 2016. Study selection: All study designs testing interventions were included as were all provider and patient types. Two reviewers independently conducted a title and abstract review, followed by a full-text review. Data extraction: Two reviewers independently extracted a priori variables and used consensus for disagreements. Quality assessment was conducted using the Assessment of Quantitative Studies published by the Effective Public Health Practice Group. Data synthesis: We identified 11 studies involving at least 1200 providers. Nine of the studies showed improvements in outcome measure use rates but only three of these studies used an experimental or quasi-experimental design. Eight of the studies used an educational approach in the intervention and three used audit and feedback. Poor intervention description and quality of studies limited recommendations. Conclusions: Increased attention to testing interventions focused on known barriers, matched to behavior change techniques, and with stronger designs is warranted.",

      "abstract": "Rates of hospital presentation for self-harm have increased in recent years, and although clinical practice guidelines on clinical provision prioritize positive patient experiences, the quality of provision remains variable. This systematic review provides an updated and extended synthesis of qualitative research on the following: (a) patients\u2019 experiences of treatment following presentation to hospital; and (b) patients\u2019 perceptions of the impact of treatment on recurrent self-harm and/or suicidal ideation, and future help-seeking. Twenty-six studies were identified for inclusion in the final synthesis. Three meta-themes emerged: (a) individuals undertake extensive identity work when presenting with self-harm, navigating the process of becoming a patient, and negotiating the type of patient they want to be; (b) care ranges from gentle to hostile, with care at admission and discharge being particularly disorientating; and (c) negative experiences of clinical treatment may increase future self-harm. Emerging research gaps include the need for further theoretically informed qualitative research in this area.",

      "abstract": "Introduction: Despite the high prevalence of intimate partner violence (IPV) perpetration by men who use substances, limited evidence exists about how best to reduce IPV among this group. Method: A systematic narrative review with meta-analysis determined the effectiveness of interventions to reduce IPV by men who use substances. Inclusion criteria were randomized and nonrandomized controlled trials; adult heterosexual male IPV perpetrators where at least 60% of participants were alcohol and/or drug users; the intervention targeted IPV with or without targeting substance use (SU); outcomes included perpetrator and/or victim reports of IPV, SU, or both. Methodological quality was assessed. Results: Nine trials ( n = 1,014 men) were identified. Interventions were grouped into (1) integrated IPV and SU interventions ( n = 5), (2) IPV interventions with adjunct SU interventions ( n = 2), and (3) stand-alone IPV interventions ( n = 2). Cognitive behavioral and motivational interviewing therapies were the most common approaches. Data from individual trials showed a reduction in SU outcomes in the short term (\u22643months; n = 2 trials) and IPV perpetration at different time points ( n = 3 trials) for interventions compared with treatment as usual (TAU). Meta-analysis with integrated IPV and SU interventions showed no difference in SU ( n = 3 trials) or IPV outcomes ( n = 4 trials) versus SU TAU. Conclusions: Little evidence exists for effective interventions for male IPV perpetrators who use substances. Outcomes in integrated interventions were not superior to TAU in meta-analysis. Future trials should consider the nature of the relationship between IPV and SU in intervention design, duration of intervention, and type and timing of outcome measures.",

      "abstract": "Background: Although gender plays an important role in health, most healthcare providers lack knowledge in providing gender-sensitive care. Offering gender-sensitivity training for healthcare providers can help to address gender-based health inequalities. Method: A mixed-methods systematic review of gender-sensitivity training programmes or interventions for healthcare providers was undertaken to assess their outcomes and to document areas for future research. Comprehensive searches of seven international databases were conducted for peer-reviewed literature published between 1998 and 2018. Eligible studies included at least one outcome related to gender-sensitivity training for healthcare providers. Results: Twenty-nine studies met the inclusion criteria. Fourteen studies focused on gender-sensitivity in reducing gender bias towards men and women, and 15 studies focused on addressing the needs of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) patients. Thirty-seven percent of studies showed a significant improvement in gender-related knowledge, attitudes or practice after the training. Multiple training methods were used to teach gender-sensitive care. Common content of the training included learning sex/gender terminology, understanding gender issues and inequalities in health, stigma and discrimination and communication skills. The duration and frequency of interventions ranged considerably. Sex differences in training outcomes also occurred among the learners. Conclusion: Review findings highlight that although gender-sensitivity training for healthcare providers is increasing, there is insufficient evidence to determine its effectiveness. Additional, more rigorously designed studies are needed to assess the long-term implications on learner behaviours and practices, especially across a wide variety of healthcare providers.",

      "abstract": "This systematic review summarizes the parenting intervention literature for parents of children with chronic health conditions and evaluates intervention effects on parenting (parenting skills and parenting efficacy) and child (behaviour, illness severity/control and quality of life) outcomes. Systematic searches using seven electronic databases (including CINHAL, MEDLINE and PsycINFO) were used to identify relevant papers published in English between 1997 and 2017, and reference lists were searched for additional relevant articles. Ten papers reporting on eight separate studies met inclusion criteria: three studies evaluated stand-alone parenting interventions, while the remaining five studies included parenting components in broader interventions that also targeted medically oriented aspects of illness management. Results suggest that parenting interventions may lead to improved parent self-efficacy, parenting behaviour, illness severity/control, child quality of life and child behaviour; however, intervention effects were mixed and confined to parent-report outcome measures. A paucity of studies using rigorous randomized controlled trial study designs limits the conclusions that can be drawn regarding intervention efficacy. Achieving adequate enrolment and retention of families in parenting intervention trials appears to be problematic within these clinical groups. Larger samples and more diverse clinical populations will support the reliability of future evaluations of parenting interventions in this context and improve generalizability of results.",

      "abstract": "Although many researchers in psychology, religious studies, and psychiatry recognize that there is overlap in the experiences their subjects recount, disciplinary silos and challenges involved in comparing reported experiences have left us with little understanding of the mechanisms, whether biological, psychological, and/or sociocultural, through which these experiences are represented and differentiated. So-called mystical experiences, which some psychologists view as potentially sui generis, provide a test case for assessing whether we can develop an expanded framework for studying unusual experiences across disciplines and cultures. Evidence for the special nature of \u201cmystical experience\u201d rests on the operationalization of a metaphysically untestable construct in two widely used self-report scales: the Mysticism Scale and the Mystical Experiences Questionnaire. Consideration of the construct in light of research on alterations in sense of self induced by psychoactive drugs and meditation practices suggests that \u201cpositive experiences of undifferentiated unity\u201d are not sui generis, but rather a type of \u201cego dissolution.\u201d To better understand the nature and effects of unusual experiences, such as alterations in the sense of self, we need self-report measures that distinguish between generically worded experiences and the way they are appraised in terms of valence, significance, cause, and long-term effects in different contexts.",

Qualitative research on the views of children has the potential to enable a child-centered understanding of their experience of DVA, so their needs can be better met by professionals. This systematic review reports general findings from the ViOlence: Impact on Children Evidence Synthesis (VOICES) project that synthesized published qualitative research on the experiences of DVA from the perspective of children and young people. A thematic synthesis of 33 reports identified six themes: lived experience of DVA, children\u2019s agency and coping, turning points and transitions, managing relationships postseparation, impact of DVA on children, and children\u2019s expressions of hope for the future. We conclude that professionals working with children affected by DVA should be mindful of the diversity in children\u2019s experiences and listen carefully to children\u2019s own accounts.",

This robust association may be because of both pathophysiological and behavioural mechanisms. Design We employed meta-regression to examine the association between marital status and attendance at outpatient cardiac rehabilitation (CR) in published studies. Methods We searched electronic databases, for example, Medline and Science Citation Index, for published studies that reported an association between a measure of marital or partnered status and CR attendance in patients with diagnosed CHD. Results Eleven studies were identified which incorporated 6984 CHD patients. Being married/partnered was associated with significantly higher odds of attending CR. Using a fixed effects model, the pooled odds ratio of CR attendance was 1.72 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.50\u20131.97] for those who were married/partnered. There was no evidence of heterogeneity of effects ( P = 0.42) or publication bias ( P = 0.12). Conclusion CHD patients who are married or have a partner are between 1.5\u20132 times more likely to attend CR. Associations between marital status and CR attendance may partly explain CHD outcomes.",

      "abstract": "While the majority of cochlear implant recipients benefit from the device, it remains difficult to estimate the degree of benefit for a specific patient prior to implantation. Using data from 2,735 cochlear-implant recipients from across three clinics, the largest retrospective study of cochlear-implant outcomes to date, we investigate the association between 21 preoperative factors and speech recognition approximately one year after implantation and explore the consistency of their effects across the three constituent datasets. We provide evidence of 17 statistically significant associations, in either univariate or multivariate analysis, including confirmation of associations for several predictive factors, which have only been examined in prior smaller studies. Despite the large sample size, a multivariate analysis shows that the variance explained by our models remains modest across the datasets ([Formula: see text]\u20130.21). Finally, we report a novel statistical interaction indicating that the duration of deafness in the implanted ear has a stronger impact on hearing outcome when considered relative to a candidate\u2019s age. Our multicenter study highlights several real-world complexities that impact the clinical translation of predictive factors for cochlear implantation outcome. We suggest several directions to overcome these challenges and further improve our ability to model patient outcomes with increased accuracy.",

      "abstract": "Background: The prevalence and impact of chronic ankle instability (CAI) in adolescent athletes are unknown. To better develop and justify prevention strategies of lateral ankle sprains and CAI, it is important to understand the origin and associated long-term impact of CAI within populations other than adults. Purpose/Hypothesis: The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence and impact of CAI on ankle function, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), and physical activity in adolescent athletes. The hypothesis was that the presence of CAI will be commonly reported among adolescent athletes and that participants with CAI will have lower self-reported ankle function, HRQoL, and physical activity when compared with participants without CAI. Study Design: Cross-sectional study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: A cohort of 1002 healthy (able to fully participate) adolescent athletes (50.4% female; mean age, 15.6 \u00b1 1.6 years) across 8 club sport facilities and high schools completed paper-and-pencil surveys to establish the presence of CAI (Identification of Functional Ankle Instability [IdFAI]) and estimate perceived ankle function (Foot and Ankle Ability Measure [FAAM]\u2013Activities of Daily Living and FAAM-Sport), HRQoL (Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory 4.0 [PedsQL]), and physical activity (Hospital for Special Surgery Pediatric Functional Activity Brief Scale [HSS Pedi-FABS]). Results: The overall prevalence of CAI was 20.0%. Participants with unilateral CAI reported significantly lower ( P &lt; .001) ankle function (FAAM-Sport: 87.0 \u00b1 14.8) and HRQoL (total PedsQL: 89.8 \u00b1 9.8) than participants who did not have CAI (FAAM-Sport: 97.7 \u00b1 6.0; total PedsQL: 93.5 \u00b1 9.1). Physical activity was not different between participants with and without CAI. Conclusion: The prevalence of CAI was high among adolescent athletes. The presence of CAI negatively affected ankle function and HRQoL in adolescent athletes. Given the high prevalence and negative impact of CAI in an adolescent population, strategies to prevent ankle injuries and maintain physical activity are needed to alleviate future long-term consequences associated with developing CAI. These strategies should be implemented as soon as sport participation begins, as it appears that the origin of CAI may occur before adulthood.",

Participants were drawn from the Environmental Risk Longitudinal Twin Study. Loneliness was measured via self-reports at ages 12 and 18 years and also by interviewer ratings at age 18. Neighborhood characteristics were assessed between the ages of 12 and 18 via government data, systematic social observations, a resident survey, and participants\u2019 self-reports. Greater loneliness was associated with perceptions of lower collective efficacy and greater neighborhood disorder but not with more objective measures of neighborhood characteristics. Lonelier individuals perceived the collective efficacy of their neighborhoods to be lower than did their less lonely siblings who lived at the same address. These findings suggest that feelings of loneliness are associated with negatively biased perceptions of neighborhood characteristics, which may have implications for lonely individuals\u2019 likelihood of escaping loneliness.",

      "title": "Precision rehabilitation for aphasia by patient age, sex, aphasia severity, and time since stroke? A prespecified, systematic review-based, individual participant data, network, subgroup meta-analysis",
      "abstract": "Background: Stroke rehabilitation interventions are routinely personalized to address individuals\u2019 needs, goals, and challenges based on evidence from aggregated randomized controlled trials (RCT) data and meta-syntheses. Individual participant data (IPD) meta-analyses may better inform the development of precision rehabilitation approaches, quantifying treatment responses while adjusting for confounders and reducing ecological bias. Aim: We explored associations between speech and language therapy (SLT) interventions frequency (days/week), intensity (h/week), and dosage (total SLT-hours) and language outcomes for different age, sex, aphasia severity, and chronicity subgroups by undertaking prespecified subgroup network meta-analyses of the RELEASE database. Methods: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and trial registrations were systematically searched (inception-Sept2015) for RCTs, including \u2a7e 10 IPD on stroke-related aphasia. We extracted demographic, stroke, aphasia, SLT, and risk of bias data. Overall-language ability, auditory comprehension, and functional communication outcomes were standardized. A one-stage, random effects, network meta-analysis approach filtered IPD into a single optimal model, examining SLT regimen and language recovery from baseline to first post-intervention follow-up, adjusting for covariates identified a-priori. Data were dichotomized by age (\u2a7d/&gt; 65 years), aphasia severity (mild\u2013moderate/ moderate\u2013severe based on language outcomes\u2019 median value), chronicity (\u2a7d/&gt; 3 months), and sex subgroups. We reported estimates of means and 95% confidence intervals. Where relative variance was high (&gt; 50%), results were reported for completeness. Results: 959 IPD (25 RCTs) were analyzed. For working-age participants, greatest language gains from baseline occurred alongside moderate to high-intensity SLT (functional communication 3-to-4 h/week; overall-language and comprehension &gt; 9 h/week); older participants\u2019 greatest gains occurred alongside low-intensity SLT (\u2a7d 2 h/week) except for auditory comprehension (&gt; 9 h/week). For both age-groups, SLT-frequency and dosage associated with best language gains were similar. Participants \u2a7d 3 months post-onset demonstrated greatest overall-language gains for SLT at low intensity/moderate dosage (\u2a7d 2 SLT-h/week; 20-to-50 h); for those &gt; 3 months, post-stroke greatest gains were associated with moderate-intensity/high-dosage SLT (3\u20134 SLT-h/week; \u2a7e 50 hours). For moderate\u2013severe participants, 4 SLT-days/week conferred the greatest language gains across outcomes, with auditory comprehension gains only observed for \u2a7e 4 SLT-days/week; mild\u2013moderate participants\u2019 greatest functional communication gains were associated with similar frequency (\u2a7e 4 SLT-days/week) and greatest overall-language gains with higher frequency SLT (\u2a7e 6 days/weekly). Males\u2019 greatest gains were associated with SLT of moderate (functional communication; 3-to-4 h/weekly) or high intensity (overall-language and auditory comprehension; (&gt; 9 h/weekly) compared to females for whom the greatest gains were associated with lower-intensity SLT (&lt; 2 SLT-h/weekly). Consistencies across subgroups were also evident; greatest overall-language gains were associated with 20-to-50 SLT-h in total; auditory comprehension gains were generally observed when SLT &gt; 9 h over \u2a7e 4 days/week. Conclusions: We observed a treatment response in most subgroups\u2019 overall-language, auditory comprehension, and functional communication language gains. For some, the maximum treatment response varied in association with different SLT-frequency, intensity, and dosage. Where differences were observed, working-aged, chronic, mild\u2013moderate, and male subgroups experienced their greatest language gains alongside high-frequency/intensity SLT. In contrast, older, moderate\u2013severely impaired, and female subgroups within 3 months of aphasia onset made their greatest gains for lower-intensity SLT. The acceptability, clinical, and cost effectiveness of precision aphasia rehabilitation approaches based on age, sex, aphasia severity, and chronicity should be evaluated in future clinical RCTs.",

A literature search was performed using 11 databases, from inception to June 2017. Keywords such as pediatric, caregiver, parents, cancer, and intervention were used. Only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included. Studies with full text available online in English and those conducted of caregivers of children diagnosed with any form of cancer were included. Eleven RCTs were included in the analysis. Our meta-analysis revealed that PEIs have small to large effects on three outcomes, including post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSSs), mood, and problem-solving skills. However, the outcomes from PEI were not superior to the usual standard of care for anxiety, depression, and social support. Our meta-analysis provided moderate evidence that PEI enhances psychological and coping outcomes. Because coping affects both physical and psychological health, health care professionals could consider including coping as a core component in PEI delivered to caregivers of children with cancer.",

Furthermore, the relationships between two acculturation dimensions (adaptation and maintenance) and well-being is investigated within the immigrant group. In a first study, somatic well-being is studied in a sample of 519 Belgian majority members, 229 Turkish immigrants, and 232 Turkish majority members. Turkish immigrants reported the most somatic complaints, followed by Turkish majorities and Belgian majorities. No relationships with acculturation were found. In a second study, emotional well-being (sadness/anxiety, anger, and positive emotions) was investigated in 519 Belgians, 151 Turkish immigrants, and 200 Turkish majority members. No differences were found for sadness/anxiety. Turkish majority members report less anger than the other two groups. For positive emotions, Turkish majority members score the lowest, followed by the Turkish immigrant group and the Belgian majority members. In the immigrant group only adaptation was associated with more positive emotions. Both studies demonstrate that indices of well-being behave differently in cross-cultural comparative research.",

      "title": "Oral language comprehension interventions in 1\u20138-year-old children with language disorders or difficulties: A systematic scoping review",
      "abstract": "Background and aims The most severe problems in language manifest as difficulties in comprehending oral language. These difficulties are persistent and expose individuals to several risk factors. There is a lack of intervention research in the area of oral language comprehension, and no reviews have focused solely on oral language comprehension interventions in young children. The aim of this review was to identify interventions targeting oral language comprehension in children 8 years or younger with language disorders or difficulties. The review also examined the possible intervention foci, efficacy, and level of evidence of these interventions. Methods A systematic scoping review of eight databases was carried out. Twenty of 2399 articles met the inclusion criteria and a further six articles were identified through reference lists of sourced articles. These 26 articles described 25 studies. Altogether 2460 children aged 1\u20138 years participated in the 25 studies. The data from these studies were extracted and analysed, and the intervention foci, efficacy, and level of evidence were evaluated. Main contribution: The reviewed interventions focused on three aspects: modifying the communicative environment of the child; targeting aspects of the child\u2019s language; or targeting the child\u2019s language processing. Of the included studies, 80% indicated positive effects on participants\u2019 oral language comprehension. The level of evidence of the included studies varied. With few exceptions, researchers and practitioners can have moderate confidence in the results of the included studies indicating that it is possible to ameliorate difficulties in oral language comprehension. Conclusions This review summarises the existing evidence on oral language comprehension interventions in young children with language disorders or difficulties. The evidence base is still limited, and more research is urgently needed. The results suggest that though not all interventions seem to provide desired outcomes, there are several interventions indicating efficacy to target problems in oral language comprehension in 1\u20138-year-old children with language disorders or difficulties. A careful choice of therapy technique and collaboration with people in the child\u2019s environment is required to maximize outcomes. Implications: The results suggest that young children\u2019s oral language comprehension skills can be improved by guiding parents and clinicians in their communication strategies, and by clinician-implemented interventions targeting aspects of the child\u2019s language. The research on interventions targeting children\u2019s language processing is limited, and the results mixed. The present study provides information on different oral language comprehension interventions and their outcomes. The findings are readily applicable for clinical use.",

      "abstract": "In recent years, various levels of the Chinese government have undertaken the task of developing new models of community-based mental health services. Greater availability and higher quality will not result in substantial improvements if those suffering from mental illnesses do not use the services. This article examines not only people\u2019s cultural perception of mental health and help-seeking but also their practical concerns and preferences about mental health service provision in urban China. The study analyzes qualitative data from in-depth interviews with 50 respondents who belong to the most psychologically distressed subgroup (with the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10) score \u2265 25) identified in a household survey in Beijing. While stigma about mental illness and help-seeking is real and well described, most interviewees are also not aware of the availability of professional mental health services. They believe that professional services target the upper-middle and upper classes, and are outside the sphere of their daily life and socio-economic status. The interviewees do not welcome the prospect of a mental health clinic or treatment center in their neighborhood due to concerns about stigma and confidentiality; instead, they support the creation of mental health referral services and promotion programs within the community or on the Internet. The findings suggest that the development of community-based mental health services in mainland China should take into account not only the cultural constraints that make people reluctant to seek professional help but also the structural inadequacies that deter potential user groups from accessing such services.",

Study Design Cross\u2010sectional survey. Setting OpenAI's ChatGPT\u20103.5 Platform. Methods Two board\u2010certified otolaryngologists (HZ, RS) input 2 sets of 30 text\u2010based questions (open\u2010ended and single\u2010answer multiple\u2010choice) into the ChatGPT\u20103.5 model. Responses were rated on a scale (correct, partially correct, incorrect) by each Otolaryngologist working simultaneously with the AI model. Interrater agreement percentage was based on binomial distribution for calculating the 95% confidence intervals and performing significance tests. Statistical significance was defined as P &lt; .05 for 2\u2010sided tests. Results In testing open\u2010ended questions, the ChatGPT model had 56.7% of initially answering questions with complete accuracy, and 86.7% chance of answer with some accuracy (corrected agreement = 80.1%; P &lt; .001).

For multiple\u2010choice questions, the ChatGPT model performed substantially worse (43.3% correct). Conclusion ChatGPT currently does not provide reliably accurate responses to sophisticated questions in Otolaryngology.

      "abstract": "We examine how organizations select some routines to be changed, but not others, during organizational search. Selection is a critical step that links an exogenous trigger for change, change in individual routines, and larger processes of organizational adaptation. Drawing on participant observation of an initiative to improve perioperative efficiency in seven Ontario hospitals, we find that organizational roles shape selection by influencing both politics and frames in organizational search. Roles shape politics by defining the role-specific goals of the people who have authority to change a routine. Organizations will not select a routine for change unless at least some elites\u2014people with role-based authority\u2014frame the existing routine as negatively affecting their role-specific goals. Roles also shape individuals\u2019 frames. Because people are only partially exposed to interdependencies between routines in their day-to-day work, they may not be fully aware of the diverse impact that an existing routine can have on their goals. Proponents for change can use strategic framing to focus attention on interdependencies between routines to get elites to better see how an existing routine negatively affects their goals. They can also change elites\u2019 goals by using strategic framing to focus attention on new and broader goals that the change in routine would promote.",

      "abstract": "Background: The aim of the study was to evaluate the achievement of \u2018no evidence of disease activity\u2019 (NEDA) over a 12-month period in a large multicenter population with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) treated with delayed-release dimethyl fumarate (DMF) and teriflunomide (TRF) using a propensity-score adjustment. Methods: A time-to-event method was used to determine the percentages of patients with RRMS (pwRRMS) in both groups achieving NEDA 3 (no relapses, no 12-week confirmed disability progression, and no new T2/gadolinium-enhancing brain lesions). We described the safety profile of the investigated drugs. Results: Of the 587 pwRRMS treated with DMF and the 316 pwRRMS treated with TRF, 468 pwRRMS were successfully paired by propensity score: 234 on DMF and 234 on TRF. The percentages of pwRRMS who achieved NEDA 3 were 80.3% in the DMF group and 77.2% in the TRF group. Serious adverse events occurred in four (1.9%) pwRRMS on DMF and in three (1.3%) pwRRMS on TRF. Conclusions: DMF and TRF significantly impacted RRMS disease activity in our study. Serious safety concerns were recorded in less than 2% of the studied population.",

      "abstract": "Home-based programmes may offer an alternative to conventional programmes or as a means of maintaining physical fitness after graduating from centre-based programmes. We sought to examine the effectiveness of home-based exercise programmes on exercise capacity in patients with heart failure compared with usual medical care. Electronic databases were searched to identify randomized controlled trials. Protocols included an initial period of centre-based exercise followed by exercise at home, home-based exercise only and concurrent centre and home-based exercise. Outcome measures included peak oxygen consumption, exercise duration and the six-minute walk test. Nineteen relevant studies were identified for review. The mean improvement in peak oxygen consumption was 2.86 ml/kg per min [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.43-4.29]. Exercise duration increased by 1.94 min (95% CI: 0.89-2.98) and distance on the six-minute walk test was increased by 30.41 m (95% CI: 6.13-54.68). Other reported benefits of home-based programmes include increased quality of life and lowered hospital admission rates. In conclusion, home-based exercise programmes have been shown to benefit people with heart failure in the short term. Further research is required to investigate the long-term effects of home exercise and to determine the optimal strategies for improving exercise adherence in patients with heart failure.",

Concerns regarding the use of bibliometrics in general, and the impact factor score (IFS) in particular, have been discussed across disciplines including social work. Although there are frequent mentions in the literature of the IFS as an indicator of the impact or quality of scholars' work, little empirical work has been published regarding the validity of such use. Method: A proportionate, stratified, random sample, of n=323 articles was selected from 17 Web of Science listed social work journals published during the 1992 to 1994 period. Results: The relationship between journals'IFSs and the actual impact of articles published in those journals (predictive validity) was r= .41 (short term) and r = .42 (long term).Conclusion: The practice of using the IFS as a proxy indicator of article impact merits significant concern as well as further empirical investigation.",

      "abstract": "Background: Early diagnosis and treatment of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) are associated with better outcomes; however, diagnostic delays remain a major problem. Objective: Describe the prevalence, determinants and consequences of delayed diagnoses. Methods: This single-centre ambispective study analysed 146 adult relapsing-remitting MS patients (2016\u20132021) for frequency and determinants of diagnostic delays and their associations with clinical, cognitive, imaging and biochemical measures. Results: Diagnostic delays were identified in 77 patients (52.7%), including 42 (28.7%) physician-dependent cases and 35 (24.0%) patient-dependent cases. Diagnosis was delayed in 22 (15.1%) patients because of misdiagnosis by a neurologist. A longer diagnostic delay was associated with trends towards greater Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores ( B = 0.03; p = 0.034) and greater z-score of the blood neurofilament light chain ( B = 0.35; p = 0.031) at the time of diagnosis. Compared with patients diagnosed at their first clinical relapse, patients with a history of &gt;1 relapse at diagnosis ( n = 63; 43.2%) had a trend towards greater EDSS scores ( B = 0.06; p = 0.006) and number of total ( B = 0.13; p = 0.040) and periventricular ( B = 0.06; p = 0.039) brain lesions. Conclusion: Diagnostic delays in MS are common, often determined by early misdiagnosis and associated with greater disease burden.",

In Malawi, 53% of households own radios however few radio programmes in Malawi focus on health issues in the context of medical research. An interactive health-talk radio programme \u2018 Umoyo nkukambirana\u2019 was introduced by Malawi-Liverpool-Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Programme on a national radio station. The aim was to increase awareness of health and medical research, and improve engagement between researchers, healthcare workers and the public. The content and presentation were developed through participatory community consultations. Focus Group Discussions were conducted with established Radio Listening Clubs whilst quantitative data was collected using toll free FrontlineSMS to explore national response. A total of 277 to 695 SMS (Median: 477) were received per theme. The majority of SMS were received from men (64%) and mainly from rural areas (54%). The programme improved knowledge of medical research, health and dispelled misconceptions. This study suggests that the radio may be an effective means of increasing the exposure of men to health information in resource poor settings.",

Little research has investigated the attitudes of wider publics to NIPD. This study used Q-methodology, which combines factor analysis with qualitative comments, to identify four distinct \u201cviewpoints\u201d amongst 71 UK men and women: 1. NIPD as a new tool in the ongoing societal discrimination against the disabled; 2. NIPD as a positive clinical application offering peace of mind in pregnancy; 3. NIPD as a medical option justified for severe disorders only; and 4. NIPD as a valid expansion of personal choice. Concerns included the \u201ctrivialisation of testing\u201d and the implications of commercial/direct-to-consumer tests. Q-methodology has considerable potential to identify viewpoints and frame public debate about new technologies.",

      "abstract": "Objective: To describe the development and psychometric evaluation of a new patient-reported measure that assesses a person\u2019s social network in the first six months post stroke. Although it is known that the social networks of those with stroke and aphasia are vulnerable to change, there is currently no social network scale that has been validated for this population. Design and setting: Repeated measures psychometric study, evaluating internal consistency, construct validity, and responsiveness to change of the Stroke Social Network Scale. Participants were interviewed two weeks, three months and six months following a first stroke. Measures: Stroke Social Network Scale; Medical Outcomes Studies (MOS) Social Support Survey; National Institute of Health Stroke Scale; Stroke and Aphasia Quality of Life Scale-39g; Frenchay Aphasia Screening Test. Results: 87 participants were recruited, of whom 71 were followed up at six months. Factor analysis was used with the Stroke Social Network Scale to derive five subdomains: satisfaction; children; relatives; friends; and groups, which explained 63% of variance. There was good evidence for the scale\u2019s internal consistency (\u03b1 = 0.85); acceptability; and convergent (r = 0.34; r = 0.53) and discriminant validity (r = \u22120.10; r = \u22120.19). It differentiated between those with high versus low perceived social support ( p = 0.01). Moderate changes from two weeks to six months supported responsiveness (d = 0.32; standardised response mean (SRM) = 0.46), with the friends factor, as expected, showing more change than the children\u2019s factor (friends factor: d = 0.46; SRM = 0.50; children\u2019s factor: d = 0.06; SRM = 0.19). Conclusions: The Stroke Social Network Scale is a new measure that demonstrates good internal consistency, validity and responsiveness to change.",

      "title": "Predicting post-stroke cognitive impairment using acute CT neuroimaging: A systematic review and meta-analysis",
      "abstract": "Background Identifying whether acute stroke patients are at risk of cognitive decline could improve prognostic discussions and management. Structural computed tomography neuroimaging is routine in acute stroke, and may identify those at risk of post-stroke dementia or post-stroke cognitive impairment (PSCI). Aim To systematically review the literature to identify which stroke or pre-stroke features on brain computed tomography scans, performed at the time of stroke, are associated with post-stroke dementia or PSCI. Summary of review We searched electronic databases to December 2020. We included studies reporting acute stroke brain computed tomography, and later diagnosis of a cognitive syndrome. We created summary estimates of size of unadjusted association between computed tomography features and cognition. Of 9536 citations, 28 studies (41 papers) were eligible (N = 7078, mean age 59.8\u201378.6 years). Cognitive outcomes were post-stroke dementia (10 studies), PSCI (17 studies), and one study analyzed both. Fifteen studies (N = 2952) reported data suitable for meta-analyses. White matter lesions (WML) (six studies, N = 1054, OR = 2.46, 95% CI = 1.25\u20134.84), cerebral atrophy (four studies, N = 558, OR = 2.80, 95% CI = 1.21\u20136.51), and pre-existing stroke lesions (three studies, N = 352, OR = 2.38, 95% CI = 1.06\u20135.32) were associated with post-stroke dementia. WML (four studies, N = 473, OR = 3.46, 95% CI = 2.17\u20135.52) were associated with PSCI. Other computed tomography features were either not associated with cognitive outcome, or there were insufficient data. Conclusions Cognitive impairment following stroke is of great concern to patients and carers. Features seen on visual assessment of acute stroke computed tomography brain scans are strongly associated with cognitive outcomes. Clinicians should consider when and how this information should be discussed with stroke survivors.",

      "abstract": "There has been a growing academic recognition of the increasing significance of psychologically \u2013 and behaviourally \u2013 informed modes of governance in recent years in a variety of different states. We contend that this academic research has neglected one important theme, namely the growing use of experiments as a way of developing and testing novel policies. Drawing on extensive qualitative and documentary research, this paper develops critical perspectives on the impacts of the psychological sciences on public policy, and considers more broadly the changing experimental form of modern states. The tendency for emerging forms of experimental governance to be predicated on very narrow, socially disempowering, visions of experimental knowledge production is critiqued. We delineate how psychological governance and emerging forms of experimental subjectivity have the potential to enable more empowering and progressive state forms and subjectivities to emerge through more open and collective forms of experimentation.",

Facial and vocal masculinity are linked to perceptions of trustworthiness; however, while feminine faces are generally considered to be trustworthy, vocal trustworthiness is associated with masculinized vocal features.

In Experiment 1, cooperativeness ratings of male and female voices were examined against four vocal measurements: fundamental frequency ( F 0 ), pitch variation ( F 0 \u2212SD), formant dispersion ( D f ), and formant position ( P f ). Feminine pitch traits ( F 0 and F 0 \u2212SD) and masculine formant traits ( D f and P f ) were associated with higher cooperativeness ratings. In Experiment 2, manipulated voices with feminized F 0 were found to be more cooperative than voices with masculinized F 0 , among both male and female speakers, confirming our results from Experiment 1. Feminine pitch qualities may indicate an individual who is friendly and non-threatening, while masculine formant qualities may reflect an individual that is socially dominant or prestigious, and the perception of these associated traits may influence the perceived cooperativeness of the speakers.",

The aim of this meta-analysis was to provide an overview of the effectiveness of PBDPs, accounting for the potential influence of study, program, and sample characteristics through moderator analyses. We included 11 manuscripts, seven published and four unpublished, yielding 93 effect sizes ( N = 3,013). Eight studies were quasi-experimental and three were randomized controlled trials. The overall effect of PBDPs was significant and small ( d = 0.153, 95% confidence interval [CI] = [0.026, 0.281]), and may have been somewhat inflated by possible publication bias, while study quality was generally low. Moderator analyses showed that the overall effect was largely driven by the small-to-medium effect of PBDPs on recidivism ( d = 0.414, 95% CI = [0.153, 0.676]). It is therefore concluded that PBDPs may be a promising intervention to reduce recidivism, although more (robust) research is needed.",

      "abstract": "Background Healthcare delivery will change through the increasing use of artificial intelligence (AI). Physicians are likely to be among the professions most affected, though to what extent is not yet clear. Objective We analyzed physicians\u2019 and AI experts\u2019 stances towards AI-induced changes. This concerned (1) physicians\u2019 tasks, (2) job replacement risk, and (3) implications for the ways of working, including human\u2013AI interaction, changes in job profiles, and hierarchical and cross-professional collaboration patterns. Methods We adopted an exploratory, qualitative research approach, using semi-structured interviews with 24 experts in the fields of AI and medicine, medical informatics, digital medicine, and medical education and training. Thematic analysis of the interview transcripts was performed. Results Specialized tasks currently performed by physicians in all areas of medicine would likely be taken over by AI, including bureaucratic tasks, clinical decision support, and research. However, the concern that physicians will be replaced by an AI system is unfounded, according to experts; AI systems today would be designed only for a specific use case and could not replace the human factor in the patient\u2013physician relationship. Nevertheless, the job profile and professional role of physicians would be transformed as a result of new forms of human\u2013AI collaboration and shifts to higher-value activities. AI could spur novel, more interprofessional teams in medical practice and research and, eventually, democratization and de-hierarchization. Conclusions The study highlights changes in job profiles of physicians and outlines demands for new categories of medical professionals considering AI-induced changes of work. Physicians should redefine their self-image and assume more responsibility in the age of AI-supported medicine. There is a need for the development of scenarios and concepts for future job profiles in the health professions as well as their education and training.",

      "abstract": "This paper evaluates how researchers are currently citing meta-analytic results and provides specific recommendations for interpreting the information provided by meta-analysis (MA). The past four decades have seen a proliferation of MA research across the organizational sciences and myriad improvements to how MA is conducted. MAs are cited more frequently than individual primary studies and have a substantial influence on subsequent research and theorizing. Yet the consumption of meta-analytic results in organizational scholarship remains superficial. We evaluate citation practices for four seminal MAs and find that authors predominantly interpret meta-analytic findings in the simplest way possible: as evidence of the existence of a relationship between variables. In focusing only on this basic finding, citing authors neglect the complexity and rich detail provided by MA. We offer advice for how researchers can more effectively leverage the strengths of meta-analytic findings to inform subsequent research by taking advantage of the benefits that meta-analytic methodology can provide for the explanation of organizational phenomena.",

      "abstract": "The structure of veterinary medicine is changing rapidly from that of traditional small privately owned practices to one of corporate franchises, often positioned within retail outlets. Accompanying this trend has been the increasing presence of women, such that they now dominate clinical practice. To what extent are these two issues, increasing feminisation and corporatisation, linked? Since the mid-1990s, corporate providers have largely displaced the traditional self-employed practice ownership/partnership model. This has informed a blame discourse whereby feminisation is associated with industry restructuring given women\u2019s alleged preferences for predictable, flexible corporate employment, plus a lack of entrepreneurial ambition towards practice ownership. Drawing upon in-depth semi-structured interviews with women veterinary surgeons and key industry stakeholders, we critically analyse such arguments. We illustrate that diverse notions of corporate masculinity, operating in parallel with the entrepreneurial masculinity of traditional practice, generate this blame discourse and underpin women\u2019s limited progression into self-employed practice ownership. This has implications for the future structure of the profession and the careers of forthcoming generations of veterinary surgeons.",

In this overview, we outline the challenges that gender poses to achieving Decade goals, and discuss four cross-cutting feminist principles for research to address those challenges: Inclusiveness and Diversity, Context, Power and Privilege, and Activism. We discuss specific limitations of traditional research, and emphasize the need for new models that view the world in more complex, context-based ways. We underscore the importance of generating new, diversity-mindful research questions and of developing and accepting new methods to answer them. We discuss policy implications, stressing the need for activism. We hope this work will encourage the expansion of feminist scholarship in the new millennium and be helpful to researchers, educators, and policymakers in working to achieve the goals of the Decade of Behavior.",

This \u2018social determinants\u2019 perspective focuses on the myriad demographic and societal factors that shape health and well-being. Heeding calls for the mainstreaming of two very specific health determinants - sex and gender - we incorporate both into our analysis of the health gap experienced by girls and women in Canada. However, we take an intersectional approach in that we argue that a comprehensive picture of health inequities must, in addition to considering sex and gender, include a context sensitive analysis of all the major dimensions of social stratification. In the case of the current worldwide economic downturn, and the uniquely diverse Canadian population spread over a vast territory, this means thinking carefully about how socioeconomic status, race, ethnicity, immigrant status, employment status and geography uniquely shape the health of all Canadians, but especially girls and women. We argue that while a social determinants of health perspective is important in its own right, it needs to be understood against the backdrop of broader structural processes that shape Canadian health policy and practice. By doing so we can observe how the social safety net of all Canadians has been eroding, especially for those occupying vulnerable social locations.",

      "abstract": "Objective: On-going evidence is required to support the validity of inferences about change and group differences in the evaluation of health programs, particularly when self-report scales requiring substantial subjectivity in response generation are used as outcome measures. Following this reasoning, the aim of this study was to replicate the factor structure and investigate the measurement invariance of the latest version of the Health Education Impact Questionnaire, a widely used health program evaluation measure. Methods: An archived dataset of responses to the most recent version of the English-language Health Education Impact Questionnaire that uses four rather than six response options (N = 3221) was analysed using exploratory structural equation modelling and confirmatory factor analysis appropriate for ordered categorical data. Metric and scalar invariance were studied following recent recommendations in the literature to apply fully invariant unconditional models with minimum constraints necessary for model identification. Results: The original eight-factor structure was replicated and all but one of the scales (Self Monitoring and Insight) was found to consist of unifactorial items with reliability of \u2a7e0.8 and satisfactory discriminant validity. Configural, metric and scalar invariance were established across pre-test to post-test and population sub-groups (sex, age, education, ethnic background). Conclusion: The results support the high level of interest in the Health Education Impact Questionnaire, particularly for use as a pre-test/post-test measure in experimental studies, other pre\u2013post evaluation designs and system-level monitoring and evaluation.",

      "abstract": "Background: Stroke survivors are at an increased risk of developing post-stroke cognitive impairment and post-stroke dementia; those at risk could be identified by brain imaging routinely performed at stroke onset. Aim: This systematic review aimed to identify features which are associated with post-stroke cognitive impairment (including dementia) on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) performed at stroke diagnosis. Summary of review: We searched the literature from inception to January 2022 and identified 10,284 records. We included studies that performed MRI at the time of stroke (0\u201330 days after a stroke) and assessed cognitive outcome at least 3 months after stroke. We synthesized findings from 26 papers, comprising 27 stroke-populations (N = 13,114, average age range = 40\u201380 years, 19\u201362% female). When data were available, we pooled unadjusted (OR u ) and adjusted (OR a ) odds ratios. We found associations between cognitive outcomes and presence of cerebral atrophy (three studies, N = 453, OR u = 2.48, 95% CI = 1.15\u20134.62), presence of microbleeds (two studies, N = 9151, OR a = 1.36, 95% CI = 1.08\u20131.70), and increasing severity of white matter hyperintensities (three studies, N = 704, OR a = 1.26, 95% CI = 1.06\u20131.49). Increasing cerebral small vessel disease score was associated with cognitive outcome following unadjusted analysis only (two studies, N = 499, OR u = 1.34, 95%CI = 1.12\u20131.61; three studies, N = 950, OR a = 1.23, 95% CI = 0.96\u20131.57). Associations remained after controlling for pre-stroke cognitive impairment. We did not find associations between other stroke features and cognitive outcome, or there were insufficient data. Conclusion: Acute stroke MRI features may enable healthcare professionals to identify patients at risk of post-stroke cognitive problems. However, there is still substantial uncertainty about the prognostic utility of acute MRI for this.",

      "abstract": "Functional neurological disorder (FND), formerly known as conversion disorder, causes a high burden of disability and distress, and is amongst the most commonly encountered conditions in neurology clinics and neuropsychiatric services, yet the therapeutic evidence base is somewhat limited. There has been recent interest in the therapeutic potential of psychedelics such as psilocybin and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), and in recent studies psychedelics have shown promise in treating a range of neuropsychiatric conditions. Modification of neural circuits associated with self-representation is thought to underlie some of this effect, and as some contemporary theories of FND focus on aberrant somatic self-representation, psychedelics may therefore represent an unexplored treatment option for FND. We systematically reviewed studies involving the use of psychedelics in FND. Nine studies published between 1954 and 1967, with a total of 26 patients, were identified. Due to restriction of licencing of psychedelic drugs since this period, no modern studies were identified. In most cases, patients received a course of psychotherapy with variable adjunctive administration of psychedelics (in a combination known as \u2018psycholytic therapy\u2019), with protocols varying between studies. Of those treated, 69% ( n = 18) were found to have made at least some recovery on heterogeneous and subjective clinician-rated criteria. Adverse events were mostly mild and transient; however, at least one patient terminated the study due to distressing effects. All included studies were of low quality, often lacking control groups and valid outcome measures. Although no conclusions on efficacy may be drawn from these data, further research may help to determine whether psychedelics offer a feasible, safe and effective treatment for FND.",

We aimed to provide a comprehensive overview of the current evidence regarding the effectiveness of different psychosocial interventions in reducing all forms of violence toward others. We have conducted an umbrella review of previous meta-analyses using standard approaches and converted findings on effectiveness into odds ratios. We tested for the underlying quality of the meta-analytic evidence by examining heterogeneity, excess statistical significance, prediction intervals, and small study effects. We identified 16 meta-analyses, including nine investigating psychosocial interventions, and five legislative and policy changes. Most meta-analyses reported positive effects of tested interventions. The strongest effects were found for sports-based initiatives, and the weakest for general population programs aimed at early childhood, youth development, and reducing sexual assault perpetration by men. Legislative changes had varying effectiveness. We conclude that simple, scalable, and cost-efficient programs, such as sport-based initiatives, have the clearest empirical support as population-based approaches to violence prevention.",

However, the reported appearances of adenomyosis on TVS are numerous and there is no consensus in the literature as to which image characteristics are unequivocally diagnostic; clarification would assist the sonographer in confidently providing a diagnosis. Following a thorough search of the electronic databases Embase and Medline, nine articles assessing the diagnostic accuracy of the sonographic features of adenomyosis on TVS against a gold standard reference test (histology post hysterectomy), using sensitivity and specificity, were selected for inclusion. The methodological quality of each of the nine included articles was assessed using a valid and reliable checklist tool. Four articles were considered suitable for inclusion in meta-analysis, which was facilitated by Meta-DiSc (Clinical Biostatistics Unit, Ram\u00f3n y Cajal Hospital, Madrid, Spain). Meta-analysis showed that the heterogeneity between the studies was too great to allow statistical pooling of data. There was a wide between-study variation in the proficiency of six well-documented ultrasound characteristics of adenomyosis to correctly identify the disease, despite an apparent similarity in the studies\u2019 populations, interventions and outcomes. This systematic review has been unable to draw a concise conclusion about which ultrasound image characteristics are most reliable in the correct diagnosis of adenomyosis. Further research is required into the sonographic features of adenomyosis with much larger study groups to attempt to establish those features that could enhance the reliability of ultrasound image interpretation.",

      "title": "Comparing Strategies for Modeling Competing Risks in Discrete-Event Simulations: A Simulation Study and Illustration in Colorectal Cancer",
      "abstract": "Background. Different strategies toward implementing competing risks in discrete-event simulation (DES) models are available. This study aims to provide recommendations regarding modeling approaches that can be defined based on these strategies by performing a quantitative comparison of alternative modeling approaches. Methods. Four modeling approaches were defined: 1) event-specific distribution (ESD), 2) event-specific probability and distribution (ESPD), 3) unimodal joint distribution and regression model (UDR), and 4) multimodal joint distribution and regression model (MDR). Each modeling approach was applied to uncensored individual patient data in a simulation study and a case study in colorectal cancer. Their performance was assessed in terms of relative event incidence difference, relative absolute event incidence difference, and relative entropy of time-to-event distributions. Differences in health economic outcomes were also illustrated for the case study. Results. In the simulation study, the ESPD and MDR approaches outperformed the ESD and UDR approaches, in terms of both event incidence differences and relative entropy. Disease pathway and data characteristics, such as the number of competing risks and overlap between competing time-to-event distributions, substantially affected the approaches\u2019 performance. Although no considerable differences in health economic outcomes were observed, the case study showed that the ESPD approach was most sensitive to low event rates, which negatively affected performance. Conclusions. Based on overall performance, the recommended modeling approach for implementing competing risks in DES models is the MDR approach, which is defined according to the general strategy of selecting the time-to-event first and the corresponding event second. The ESPD approach is a less complex and equally performing alternative if sufficient observations are available for each competing event (i.e., the internal validity shows appropriate data representation).",

      "abstract": "A quarter of ischaemic strokes are lacunar subtype, typically neurologically mild, usually resulting from intrinsic cerebral small vessel pathology, with risk factor profiles and outcome rates differing from other stroke subtypes. This European Stroke Organisation (ESO) guideline provides evidence-based recommendations to assist with clinical decisions about management of lacunar ischaemic stroke to prevent adverse clinical outcomes. The guideline was developed according to ESO standard operating procedures and Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology. We addressed acute treatment (including progressive lacunar stroke) and secondary prevention in lacunar ischaemic stroke, and prioritised the interventions of thrombolysis, antiplatelet drugs, blood pressure lowering, lipid lowering, lifestyle, and other interventions and their potential effects on the clinical outcomes recurrent stroke, dependency, major adverse cardiovascular events, death, cognitive decline, mobility, gait, or mood disorders. We systematically reviewed the literature, assessed the evidence and where feasible formulated evidence-based recommendations, and expert concensus statements. We found little direct evidence, mostly of low quality. We recommend that patients with suspected acute lacunar ischaemic stroke receive intravenous alteplase, antiplatelet drugs and avoid blood pressure lowering according to current acute ischaemic stroke guidelines. For secondary prevention, we recommend single antiplatelet treatment long-term, blood pressure control, and lipid lowering according to current guidelines. We recommend smoking cessation, regular exercise, other healthy lifestyle modifications, and avoid obesity for general health benefits. We cannot make any recommendation concerning progressive stroke or other drugs. Large randomised controlled trials with clinically important endpoints, including cognitive endpoints, are a priority for lacunar ischaemic stroke.",

      "abstract": "Background: Depression is a commonly studied mental disorder affecting Chinese internal (i.e., rural-to-urban) migrants. Social resources effectively reduce depression for many communities experiencing adversities. This study evaluated social-level risk factors for depression between internal migrant and non-migrant Chinese living in mainland China. Method: We conducted a random population-level survey among migrants and local residents living in Guangzhou, China. Data were collected using face-to-face interviews. We used items from the Social Support Rating Scale to measure social resource dimensions, including social network size, emotional support, structural social capital, and one (self-developed) item that measured belonging (an element of social cohesion). The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 measured depression. Correlation and regression analyses of the partial sample ( n = 678) were conducted to estimate the association between social resources and depression for migrants ( n = 383) and non-migrants ( n = 295). Results: Stratified regression analysis demonstrated that for migrants, greater belonging was associated with less depression, while age and larger friendship social network size was related to less depression among non-migrants. Conclusion: Differences emerged in our sample with regard to the types of social resources that are protective against depression between migrants and non-migrants. Interventions that provide opportunities for migrants to better integrate and feel welcomed into their new communities may reduce their depression symptoms.",

This article presents the fundamental principles of the FWB approach to facilitating soft skills in the context of trauma-informed training for managers and leaders. It describes how a participatory social learning approach advances deep, transformative, and long-lasting impacts. An exploratory mixed-methods design was adopted. Qualitative data were gathered from workshop participants through an evaluation form with open-ended questions allowing participants to provide comments on the program and how it could be enhanced. In addition, attendees participated in an online survey, which sought to capture data relating to demographics, soft skills for managers/leaders, personal well-being, and program satisfaction. Overall, the results show that the FWB program is both relevant and acceptable. The findings indicate that participants\u2019 understanding of concepts of management and well-being, particularly as it is applied to the workplace, was improved. This outcome is important because it highlights how the FWB program can contribute to the development of more accomplished managers and leaders in the future. The results of this exploratory study will be useful in informing future management and leadership training for the Timorese health workforce.",

      "abstract": "Effect sizes are often used in psychology because they are crucial when determining the required sample size of a study and when interpreting the implications of a result. Recently, researchers have been encouraged to contextualize their effect sizes and determine what the smallest effect size is that yields theoretical or practical implications, also known as the \u201csmallest effect size of interest\u201d (SESOI). Having a SESOI will allow researchers to have more specific hypotheses, such as whether their findings are truly meaningful (i.e., minimum-effect testing) or whether no meaningful effect exists (i.e., equivalence testing). These types of hypotheses should be reflected in power analyses to accurately determine the required sample size. Through a confidence-interval-focused approach and simulations, I show how to conduct power analyses for minimum-effect and equivalence testing. Moreover, I show that conducting a power analysis for the SESOI might result in inconclusive results. This confidence-interval-focused simulation-based power analysis can be easily adopted to different types of research areas and designs. Last, I provide recommendations on how to conduct such simulation-based power analyses.",

In early 2022, the Omicron variant is spreading rapidly around the world. This study explores the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a stepped-care programme of scalable, internet-based psychological interventions for distressed health workers on self-reported anxiety and depression symptoms. Methods We present the study protocol for a multicentre (two sites), parallel-group (1:1 allocation ratio), analyst-blinded, superiority, randomised controlled trial. Healthcare workers with psychological distress will be allocated either to care as usual only or to care as usual plus a stepped-care programme that includes two scalable psychological interventions developed by the World Health Organization: A guided self-help stress management guide (Doing What Matters in Times of Stress) and a five-session cognitive behavioural intervention (Problem Management Plus). All participants will receive a single-session emotional support intervention, namely psychological first aid. We will include 212 participants. An intention-to-treat analysis using linear mixed models will be conducted to explore the programme's effect on anxiety and depression symptoms, as measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire \u2013 Anxiety and Depression Scale summary score at 21 weeks from baseline. Secondary outcomes include post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms, resilience, quality of life, cost impact and cost-effectiveness. Conclusions This study is the first randomised trial that combines two World Health Organization psychological interventions tailored for health workers into one stepped-care programme.

      "abstract": "Background Due to digitization in the medical sector, many healthcare interactions are switched to online services. This study assessed the acceptance of video consultations (VCs) in cancer care, and determined drivers and barriers of acceptance. Methods A cross-sectional online-based survey study was conducted in Germany from February 2022 to February 2023. Recruitment took place at oncology outpatient clinics, general practitioners, oncology practices and via cancer-related social media channels. Inclusion criteria were a cancer diagnosis, cancer treatment and internet access. Sociodemographic, medical data, eHealth-related data were acquired via an online assessment. The Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) model was used to determine the acceptance of VC and its predictors. Results Of N = 350 cancer patients, 56.0% ( n = 196) reported high acceptance of VC, 28.0% ( n = 98) stated moderate acceptance and 16.0% ( n = 56) indicated low acceptance. Factors influencing acceptance were younger age (\u03b2 = \u2013.28, p &lt; .001), female gender (\u03b2 = .35, p = .005), stage of disease (\u03b2 = .11, p = .032), high digital confidence (\u03b2 = .14, p = .010), low internet anxiety (\u03b2 = \u2013.21, p = .001), high digital overload (\u03b2 = \u2013.12, p = .022), high eHealth literacy (\u03b2 = .14, p = .028), personal trust (\u03b2 = \u2013.25, p &lt; .001), internet use (\u03b2 = .17, p = .002), and the UTAUT predictors: performance expectancy (\u03b2 = .24, p &lt; .001), effort expectancy (\u03b2 = .26, p &lt; .001), and social influence (\u03b2 = .34, p &lt; .001). Conclusions Patients\u2019 acceptance of VC in cancer care is high. Drivers and barriers to acceptance identified should be considered for personalized applications.

However, research on the topic is contested and hampered by methodological shortcomings, leaving the broader consequences of Internet adoption unknown. We show that the past 2 decades have seen only small and inconsistent changes in global well-being and mental health that are not suggestive of the idea that the adoption of Internet and mobile broadband is consistently linked to negative psychological outcomes.

      "abstract": "Objectives Community-based social innovations (CBSIs) are one type of intervention that may help to address the complex needs of ageing populations globally. The aim of this research was to assess evidence for the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of CBSIs involving in such contexts. Methods We conducted a systematic review of CBSIs for healthy ageing in middle- and high-income countries, including any CBSI that aimed to empower people aged 50 and over by motivating them to take initiative for their own health and wellbeing. The protocol was registered with Prospero (CRD 42016051622). A comprehensive search was conducted in 15 academic databases and advanced search in Google. We included published studies from 2000 onwards in any language. Exploratory meta-analysis was conducted for quantitative studies reporting similar outcomes, and qualitative studies were analysed using thematic analysis. Narrative synthesis was conducted. Searches yielded 13,262 unique hits, from which 44 papers met the inclusion criteria. Results Most studies reported interventions having positive impacts on participants, such as reduced depression, though the majority of studies were classified as being at medium or high risk of bias. There was no evidence on costs or cost-effectiveness and very little reporting of outcomes at an organization or system level. CBSIs have the potential for positive impacts, but with nearly half of studies coming from high-income urban settings (particularly the United Kingdom and the United States of America), there is a lack of generalizability of these findings. Conclusions Our research highlights the need to improve reporting of CBSIs as complex interventions, and for improved conceptualization of these interventions to inform research and practice.",

      "abstract": "Research on religion and intimate partner violence does not appear to have integrated well the current evidence on religion/spirituality, marital functioning, and mental health and lacks a cross-sectoral perspective that bridges psychology, public health, international development, anthropology, and sociology. A better integration could reveal how religious experience could be leveraged resourcefully in developing faith-based interventions engaging religious leaders and when counseling victims/survivors and perpetrators in religious contexts. The current scoping review explored (a) the influence of religious experience on the rationalizations, behaviors and mental state of victims/survivors and perpetrators, and (b) the approaches and effectiveness of faith-based interventions to respond to domestic violence engaging religious leaders, communities, and psychologists. In pursuing these questions, we aimed to overcome the dominance of Western definitions of intimate partner violence and religion by combining evidence from sectors that are more international-looking and studies from low-and middle-income societies that historically received less attention. The review suggests the need to move toward more diversified and holistic understandings of religion and more context-specific approaches to designing faith-based interventions and counseling responses that are theologically grounded and trauma-informed and embedded in the sociological realities of the individuals and communities they seek to support.",

      "abstract": "The expression of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in human heart failure (HF) has not been widely studied. Using RNA sequencing (RNA\u2010Seq), we compared lncRNA expression in 22 explanted human HF hearts with lncRNA expression in 5 unused donor human hearts. We used Cufflinks to identify isoforms and DESeq to identify differentially expressed genes. We identified the noncoding RNAs by cross\u2010reference to Ensembl release 73 (Genome Reference Consortium human genome build 37) and explored possible functional roles using a variety of online tools. In HF hearts, RNA\u2010Seq identified 84,793 total messenger RNA coding and noncoding different transcripts, including 13,019 protein\u2010coding genes, 2,085 total lncRNA genes, and 1,064 pseudogenes. By Ensembl noncoding RNA categories, there were 48 lncRNAs, 27 pseudogenes, and 30 antisense RNAs for a total of 105 differentially expressed lncRNAs in HF hearts. Compared with donor hearts, HF hearts exhibited differential expression of 7.7% of protein\u2010coding genes, 3.7% of lncRNAs (including pseudogenes), and 2.5% of pseudogenes. There were not consistent correlations between antisense lncRNAs and parent genes and between pseudogenes and parent genes, implying differential regulation of expression. Exploratory in silico functional analyses using online tools suggested a variety of possible lncRNA regulatory roles. By providing a comprehensive profile of right ventricular polyadenylated messenger RNA transcriptome in HF, RNA\u2010Seq provides an inventory of differentially expressed lncRNAs, including antisense transcripts and pseudogenes, for future mechanistic study.",

In this article, the findings from 11 interviews with U.K. and Danish police officers with experience of investigating both adult and child homicides suggest that child homicide investigations can have a profoundly different effect on police investigators that can vary between officers. The effects experienced and coping strategies employed were similar among officers in Denmark and the United Kingdom, and these included becoming more emotionally closed and engaging in regular sport and exercise. The findings hold important implications for police training and for the welfare of current and future police homicide investigators particularly where the victim is a child.",

      "abstract": "Background: Implementation fidelity is critical in evaluating effectiveness of interventions. Aim: Identifying and summarising strategies to improve and assess the level of reporting of implementation fidelity in randomised controlled trials of palliative care complex interventions. Design: Systematic review. Data sources: Published and completed randomised controlled trials from 2000 to current evaluating effectiveness of specialised palliative care services on patient-centred outcomes in adult patients were examined. MEDLINE was searched from 2008 to 29 September 2015 and supplemented by randomised controlled trials identified in a 2008 systematic review. Results: Altogether, 20 randomised controlled trials involving 8426 patients were reviewed using 40 subcomponents of five elements of implementation fidelity (resulting in 20 \u00d7 40 = 800 items). Over 88 strategies were identified, classified under the following elements: \u2018treatment design\u2019, \u2018training providers\u2019, \u2018delivery of treatment\u2019, \u2018receipt of treatment\u2019 and \u2018enactment of treatment skills\u2019. No single overarching strategy was discovered. Strategies under \u2018treatment design\u2019 aimed to ensure equivalent treatment dose between and within intervention and control groups, and delivery of necessary ingredients. Ongoing \u2018training (of) providers\u2019 included supervision and ensuring skill acquisition. Use of treatment manuals and implementation checklists aimed to aid \u2018delivery of treatment\u2019. Research teams aimed to improve \u2018receipt of treatment\u2019 by transmitting clear information and verifying understanding, while improving \u2018enactment of treatment skills\u2019 by reviewing and reinforcing prior content. Only 26% of the items received sufficient reporting; 34% were either not used or reported on. Conclusion: Implementation fidelity in palliative care is under-recognised. A table to collate these strategies to improve implementation fidelity in palliative care research and clinical practice is proposed.",

      "abstract": "There is an increasing focus on research exploring autistic communication and community. In this review, we systematically collate and analyse how autistic adults describe their experiences of other autistic people and the relationship this has with their Quality of Life (QoL). Fifty two qualitative papers were analysed using thematic meta-synthesis. Results found many experiences of other autistic people were positive and were associated with improved QoL across a range of domains. The heterogeneity of the autistic experiences described indicates a need for further research to explore which factors predict a positive impact on QoL. Analysis also highlighted a paucity of data on autistic people with co-occurring intellectual disability in relation to this phenomenon. Implications for research and practice are discussed. Lay abstract Research has suggested that autistic people enjoy spending time with other autistic people and find them easier to talk to. We wanted to find out what autistic people say about spending time with other autistic people and whether this makes their life better. We found 52 papers which described this and reviewed what they found. We found that many autistic people had positive experiences of spending time with other autistic people and these experiences had positive impact on their lives in a range of different ways. The papers did not tell us whether this also happens for autistic people with a learning disability. More research is needed to find out more about why spending time with other autistic people helps some autistic people.",

Analysis was done using partial least square structural equation modeling. The findings revealed that social support and psychological capital had a significant direct relationship with life satisfaction and perceived stress. Only psychological capital was related to parental satisfaction and negative affect. We found that psychological capital mediated the path between social support and all four dimensions of well-being outcomes.

      "abstract": "Background: In patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), persistent inflammation and increasing disease activity are associated with increased risk of adverse events (AEs). Objectives: To assess relationships between RA disease activity and AEs of interest in patients treated with tofacitinib or tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi). Design: This was a post hoc analysis of a long-term, postauthorization safety endpoint trial of tofacitinib versus TNFi. Methods: In ORAL Surveillance, 4362 patients aged \u2a7e50 years with active RA despite methotrexate, and \u2a7e1 additional cardiovascular (CV) risk factor, were randomized 1:1:1 to tofacitinib 5 or 10 mg twice daily or TNFi for up to 72 months. Post hoc time-dependent multivariable Cox analysis evaluated the relationships between disease activity [Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI)], inflammation [C-reactive protein (CRP)], and AEs of interest. The AEs included major adverse CV events (MACE), malignancies excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC), venous thromboembolism (VTE), serious infections, herpes zoster (HZ), nonserious infections excluding HZ (NSI), and death. Results: Across treatments, risk for NSI was higher when patients had CDAI-defined active disease versus remission; MACE and VTE risks trended higher, but did not reach significance. Hazard ratios for MACE, malignancies excluding NMSC, VTE, infections, and death rose by 2\u20139% for each 5-mg/L increment in serum CRP. The interaction terms evaluating the impact of treatment assignment on the relationship between disease activity and AEs were all p &gt; 0.05. Conclusion: In ORAL Surveillance, higher NSI risk was observed in the presence of active RA versus remission. The risk of MACE and VTE directionally increased in active disease versus remission, although statistical power was limited due to small event numbers in these categories. The relationship between active disease and AEs was not impacted by treatment with tofacitinib versus TNFi. Registration: NCT02092467.",

      "abstract": "The public health and individual risks of inappropriate antibiotic prescribing and conventional over-the-counter symptomatic drugs in pediatric treatment of acute otitis media (AOM) and upper respiratory infections (URIs) are significant. Clinical research suggests that over-the-counter homeopathic medicines offer pragmatic treatment alternatives to conventional drugs for symptom relief in children with uncomplicated AOM or URIs. Homeopathy is a controversial but demonstrably safe and effective 200-year-old whole system of complementary and alternative medicine used worldwide. Numerous clinical studies demonstrate that homeopathy accelerates early symptom relief in acute illnesses at much lower risk than conventional drug approaches. Evidence-based advantages for homeopathy include lower antibiotic fill rates during watchful waiting in otitis media, fewer and less serious side effects, absence of drug-drug interactions, and reduced parental sick leave from work. Emerging evidence from basic and preclinical science research counter the skeptics\u2019 claims that homeopathic remedies are biologically inert placebos. Consumers already accept and use homeopathic medicines for self care, as evidenced by annual US consumer expenditures of $2.9 billion on homeopathic remedies. Homeopathy appears equivalent to and safer than conventional standard care in comparative effectiveness trials, but additional well-designed efficacy trials are indicated. Nonetheless, the existing research evidence on safety supports pragmatic use of homeopathy in order to \u201cfirst do no harm\u201d in the early symptom management of otherwise uncomplicated AOM and URIs in children.",

Social prescribing interventions were heterogeneous and the most common risks of bias were poor blinding and high attrition. Social prescribing interventions designed to target specific long-term conditions i.e., cancer and diabetes demonstrated significant improvements in quality of life ( n = 2 studies) and disease-specific psychological outcomes respectively ( n = 3 studies). There was some evidence for improvement in physical activity ( n = 2 studies) but most changes were within group only ( n = 4 studies).

The group offers non-judgemental support and guidance in managing anorexia. Referring to feminist writers such as Bordo (1993), MacSween (1993) and Brain (2002), it is suggested that feminism enables a conceptualisation of anorexia that prioritises social and cultural discourses, which emphasise the bias in the West towards representations of female beauty focusing on the slim, lean body. Feminist approaches to anorexia have also highlighted the emotional and psychological factors inherent in anorexia and building on this integrated approach I use the data to illustrate the way in which the pro-ana movement enables the emergence of an embodied anorexic ontology and epistemology. It is suggested that the emergence and perpetuation of this group offers a model of \u2018being\u2019 and \u2018knowing\u2019 that facilitates the emergence of a coherent anorexic subjectivity. This is sustained by the development of an \u2018ana-language\u2019 and the formalisation, legitimation and validation of ana rituals and behaviour patterns.",

      "abstract": "In recent years, the field of psychology has increasingly recognized the importance of conducting research with lower-socioeconomic-status (SES) participants. Given that SES can powerfully shape people\u2019s thoughts and actions, socioeconomically diverse samples are necessary for rigorous, generalizable research. However, even when researchers aim to collect data with these samples, they often encounter methodological and practical challenges to recruiting and retaining lower-SES participants in their studies. We propose that there are two key factors to consider when trying to recruit and retain lower-SES participants\u2014trust and accessibility. Researchers can build trust by creating personal connections with participants and communities, paying participants fairly, and considering how participants will view their research. Researchers can enhance accessibility by recruiting in participants\u2019 own communities, tailoring study administration to participants\u2019 circumstances, and being flexible in payment methods. Our goal is to provide recommendations that can help to build a more inclusive science.",

      "abstract": "Background: Therapeutic and salutogenic effects of psychedelic drugs have been attributed to psychotherapeutic or psychotherapy-like processes that can unfold during the acute psychedelic experience and beyond. Currently, there are no psychometric instruments available to comprehensively assess psychotherapeutic processes (as conceptualized by empirical psychotherapy research) in the context of psychedelic experiences. Aims: We report the initial validation of the General Change Mechanisms Questionnaire (GCMQ), a self-report instrument designed to measure five empirically established general change mechanisms (GCMs) of psychotherapy\u2014(1) resource activation, (2) therapeutic relationship, (3) problem actuation, (4) clarification, and (5) mastery\u2014in the context of psychedelic experiences. Methods: An online survey in a sample of 1153 English-speaking and 714 German-speaking psychedelic users was conducted to evaluate simultaneously developed English- and German-language versions of the GCMQ. Results: The theory-based factor structure was confirmed. The five GCMQ scales showed good internal consistency. Evidence for convergent validity with external measures was obtained. Significant associations with different settings and with therapeutic, hedonic, and escapist use motives confirmed the hypothesized context dependence of GCM-related psychedelic experiences. Indicating potential therapeutic effects, the association between cumulative stressful life events and well-being was significantly moderated by resource activation, clarification, and mastery. Factor mixture modeling revealed five distinct profiles of GCM-related psychedelic experiences. Conclusion: Initial testing indicates that the GCMQ is a valid and reliable instrument that can be used in future clinical and nonclinical psychedelic research. The five identified profiles of GCM-related experiences may be relevant to clinical uses of psychedelics and psychedelic harm reduction.",

      "abstract": "Introduction: Children exposed to parental intimate partner violence and abuse, mental illness, and substance use experience a range of problems which may persist into adulthood. These risks often co-occur and interact with structural factors such as poverty. Despite increasing evidence, it remains unclear how best to improve outcomes for children and families experiencing these adversities and address the complex issues they face. Aims and Methods: Systematic review of systematic reviews. We searched international literature databases for systematic reviews, from inception to 2021, to provide an evidence overview of the range and effectiveness of interventions to support children and families where these parental risk factors had been identified. Results: Sixty-two systematic reviews were included. The majority ( n = 59) focused on interventions designed to address single risk factors. Reviews mostly focused on parental mental health ( n = 38) and included psychological interventions or parenting-training for mothers. Only two reviews assessed interventions to address all three risk factors in combination and assessed structural interventions. Evidence indicates that families affected by parental mental health problems may be best served by integrated interventions combining therapeutic interventions for parents with parent skills training. Upstream interventions such as income supplementation and welfare reform were demonstrated to reduce the impacts of family adversity. Conclusion: Most intervention approaches focus on mitigating individual psychological harms and seek to address risk factors in isolation, which presents potentially significant gaps in intervention evidence. These interventions may not address the cumulative impacts of co-occurring risks, or social factors that may compound adversities.",

There is a need to develop effective interventions to prevent bullying among adolescents, especially in low and middle income countries. This paper presents the study protocol to develop, and evaluate the effect of multi-component school based prevention program for bullying in India. Design Quasi-experimental study. Methods The study will be conducted among 846 students of grade 7 th and 8 th in the intervention and control schools in Chandigarh, Union Territory, North India. A government and a private school will be selected purposively in each of the intervention and control arm. The intervention is based on socio-ecological model, and will be administered at individual, relationship (parents and teachers) and school level. The primary study outcome will be the proportion of students experiencing any kind of bullying (bullying, victimization, or both), in each study arm. The effectiveness of the intervention will be measured by performing difference in difference analysis and generalized estimating equations. Expected impact for public health Bullying is an aggressive behaviour with significant morbidities, including psychological or physical trauma, affecting individuals not only in their adolescence, but also later in their adulthood. This quasi-experimental study is expected to provide evidence on whether multi-component bullying prevention intervention program, can reduce the burden of bullying perpetration and victimization among school adolescents in India. The results of the study will add in the exiting literature on bullying intervention program, especially, from the low middle-income countries, as there are limited studies available on this topic in these countries.",

      "abstract": "Understanding caregivers\u2019 needs is crucial for service planning and empowering caregivers around the world. Although research on autism from Arab countries is emerging, many countries are still unrepresented. Moreover, within-country disparities are understudied. This study investigated differences in needs, service use, and satisfaction between urban or rural living caregivers of autistic children in Morocco. The \u201cAndersen Behavioral Model of Health Services Use\u201d served as a conceptual framework to investigate factors associated with receiving intervention and service satisfaction. Results from a survey among 131 Moroccan caregivers of autistic children revealed similarities and differences in urban and rural living caregivers\u2019 challenges and needs. Children from urban communities had 12 times higher odds of receiving intervention despite similar age and verbal ability. Significantly, fewer children from rural communities attended school as compared with urban communities. Limited autonomy skills in children were more challenging to rural caregivers, while limited social-communicational skills were more challenging to urban caregivers. These differences may inform healthcare policy-makers and program developers. Adaptive interventions are important to reflect regional needs, resources, and practices. Addressing enabling factors such as costs, information barriers, or stigma may help reduce both global and within-country disparities in autism care. Lay Abstract It is very important to understand the needs of caregivers to be able to empower caregivers and to develop or improve services around the world. Therefore, research in different regions is needed to understand differences in caregivers needs between countries, but also between areas within countries. This study investigated differences in needs and service use between caregivers of autistic children in Morocco, living in urban and rural areas. A total of 131 Moroccan caregivers of autistic children took part in the study and responded to an interview survey. The results showed both similarities and differences between urban and rural living caregivers\u2019 challenges and needs. Autistic children from urban communities were much more likely to receive intervention and attend school than children from rural communities, even though age and verbal skills of the two groups of children were comparable. Caregivers expressed similar needs for improved care and education, but different challenges in caring. Limited autonomy skills in children were more challenging to rural caregivers, while limited social-communicational skills were more challenging to urban caregivers. These differences may inform healthcare policy-makers and program developers. Adaptive interventions are important to respond to regional needs, resources, and practices. In addition, the results showed the importance of addressing challenges as experienced by caregivers such as costs related to care, barriers in access to information, or stigma. Addressing these issues may help reduce both global and within-country differences in autism care.",

      "title": "Plants in a \u201cSea of Relationships\u201d: Networks of Plants and Fishing in Makkovik, Nunatsiavut (Labrador, Canada)",
      "abstract": "The importance of plants to peoples of the circumpolar North is often overlooked by non-residents. This oversight stems partly from perceptions of northern diets as exclusively meat- and fish-based and from a tendency for visiting researchers to assign plants to categories of utility\u2014edible, medicinal, material\u2014without also considering complex relationships between plants and culture. This paper focuses on the \"sea of relationships\" (Cajete 2000:178) between plants and fishing in the Inuit Community of Makkovik, where plant mentors teach how plants are integrated into cultural practices and day-to-day life. We looked to Indigenous methodologies for guidance in developing research questions, learning about plants through story and practice, and understanding and communicating collective knowledge. Makkovimiut plant mentors collectively tell a story of plants and fishing, illustrated in this paper by Makkovimiut artist Aunt Nellie Winters through her Inukuluk drawings. These oral and visual stories describe plants as part of a large network of relationships connecting trees, fish, birds, soil, berries, and people. Similarly, cultural practices are connected to each other; fishing is connected to berry picking, sharing, traveling, gardening, and celebrating, among other practices. Indigenous methodologies, with their focus on relationships, encourage us to seek connections between people and plants, and broaden our understanding of utility and value. Thinking of plants in relation\u2014connected to everything in an active web of relationships\u2014helps us recognize plants as vital facilitators of cultural practices, values, and community well-being and offers insights into the different kinds of relationships we might cultivate within this interconnected web.",

      "title": "Pathological demand avoidance in children and adolescents: A systematic review",
      "abstract": "Requests for pathological demand avoidance diagnoses have increased over recent years but pathological demand avoidance remains a controversial issue. We undertook a systematic review of peer-reviewed studies of pathological demand avoidance, using standardised appraisal and synthesis methods, to assess how pathological demand avoidance is identified and to explore the relationships between pathological demand avoidance, autism and other developmental/psychiatric disorders. A search of PsycINFO/PubMed/MEDLINE/Embase identified 13 studies meeting inclusion criteria. Narrative synthesis was chosen due to methodological heterogeneity of the identified studies. Autistic children/adolescents constituted the majority of participants in most studies. Most studies provided clearly defined inclusion criteria together with adequate descriptions of participants and study settings. Almost all studies relied on the parental report of pathological demand avoidance symptoms/diagnosis. Identification of pathological demand avoidance in all studies seemed to be, directly or indirectly, based on the criteria developed by Newson et al. While eight studies used objective criteria for the identification of pathological demand avoidance, the measures used have methodological limitations. Though associations with anxiety have been reported, few studies took account of possible relationships between pathological demand avoidance and other conditions, such as anxiety. Methodological limitations restrict current conclusions regarding the uniformity or stability of the constellation of behaviours associated with pathological demand avoidance or the characteristics of individuals displaying them. Clinical implications of current research are discussed. Lay Abstract Requests for diagnoses of pathological demand avoidance have increased over recent years, but pathological demand avoidance remains a controversial issue. The concept of pathological demand avoidance has been criticised for undermining the self-advocacy of autistic people and neglecting the potential role of anxiety as a possible underlying or contributing cause. The current study was undertaken to summarise and review the methodological quality and findings from current research into pathological demand avoidance in children and adolescents. Further aims were to describe how pathological demand avoidance has been identified and to explore the relationships with autism and other developmental and psychiatric disorders. After a comprehensive search, 13 relevant studies using a wide range of methods were identified and systematic quality assessments were undertaken. All the studies had based the identification of pathological demand avoidance, directly or indirectly, on descriptions from the original study by Newson and colleagues. However, the methods used to develop these criteria were not clearly described. Most studies relied exclusively on parental report for data, and there was a general failure to take account of alternative explanations for the behaviours under study. No studies explored the views of individuals with pathological demand avoidance themselves. Problems concerning definition and measurement in the reviewed studies currently limit any conclusions regarding the uniformity or stability of the behaviours described, or the characteristics of individuals displaying them. Relationships between pathological demand avoidance and other emotional and behavioural difficulties should be explored in future research, as should the perspectives of individuals with pathological demand avoidance themselves.",

      "abstract": "Background: Clinicians need thresholds for the Patient Acceptable Symptom State (PASS) and Treatment Failure to interpret group-based patient-reported outcome measures after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury. Validated thresholds that are crucial for accurately discerning patient symptom state and facilitating effective interpretation have not been determined for long-term follow-up after ACL injury. Purpose: To calculate and validate thresholds for PASS and Treatment Failure for the International Knee Documentation Committee Subjective Knee Form (IKDC-SKF) and the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) subscales at the 10-year follow-up after ACL injury. Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: A total of 163 participants with unilateral ACL injury (treated with reconstruction or rehabilitation alone) from the Delaware-Oslo ACL Cohort were included. Thresholds for PASS were calculated for IKDC-SKF and KOOS subscales using anchor-based predictive modeling and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Too few participants had self-reported Treatment Failure to calculate thresholds for that outcome. Nonparametric bootstrapping was used to derive 95% CIs. The criterion validity of the predictive modeling and ROC-derived thresholds were assessed by comparing actual patient-reported PASS outcome with the calculated PASS outcome for each method of calculation and calculating their positive and negative predictive values with respect to the anchor questions. Results: A total of 127 (78%) participants reported satisfactory symptom state. Predictive modeling PASS thresholds (95% CIs) were 76.2 points (72.1-79.4 points) for IKDC-SKF, 85.4 points (80.9-89.2 points) for KOOS Pain, 76.5 points (67.8-84.7 points) for KOOS Symptoms, 93.8 points (90.1-96.9 points) for KOOS activities of daily living, 71.6 points (63.4-77.7 points) for KOOS Sports, and 59.0 points (53.7-63.9 points) for KOOS quality of life (QoL). Predictive modeling thresholds classified 81% to 93% of the participants as having satisfactory symptom state, whereas ROC-derived thresholds classified &gt;50% as unsatisfied. The thresholds for IKDC-SKF, KOOS Sports, and KOOS QoL resulted in the most accurate percentages of PASS among all identified thresholds and therefore demonstrate the highest validity. Conclusion: Predictive modeling provided valid PASS thresholds for IKDC-SKF and KOOS at the 10-year follow-up after ACL injury. The thresholds for IKDC-SKF, KOOS Sports, and KOOS QoL should be used when determining satisfactory outcomes. ROC-derived thresholds result in substantial misclassification rates of the participants who reported satisfactory symptom state.",

      "abstract": "Abortion has historically been ignored in geography. Although bodies and pregnancy have been increasingly studied since the 1990s, a reticence around abortion remains. In recent years, however, this has begun to change. This article critically reviews how geographers and other scholars are now considering abortion and uses three conceptual lenses of discourse, spatiality and mobility to argue that abortion should be a mainstream topic of critical concern for geographers. Through these themes we show that geographical attention to abortion makes questions of space, power, and citizenship visible in new ways and, furthermore, in ways that are only recently possible.",

      "abstract": "The mental health and wellbeing of children and young people who have been in care, primarily foster care, kinship care or residential care, remains a public health priority. The Care-experienced cHildren and young people\u2019s Interventions to improve Mental health and wEll-being outcomes Systematic review (CHIMES) synthesized evidence for the effectiveness of interventions targeting: subjective wellbeing; mental, behavioral and neurodevelopmental disorders; and suicide-related outcomes. Searches were conducted in 16 bibliographic databases and 22 websites between 1990 and 2022. This was supplemented by citation tracking, screening of relevant systematic reviews, and expert recommendation. We identified 35 interventions, with 44 evaluations via randomized controlled trials. Through meta-analyses, we found that interventions have a small beneficial impact on a variety of mental health outcomes in the short term (0\u20136 months). Interventions improved total social, emotional, and behavioral problems ( d = \u22120.15, 95% CI [\u22120.28, \u22120.02]), social-emotional functioning difficulties ( d = \u22120.18, 95% CI [\u22120.31, \u22120.05]), externalizing problem behaviors ( d = \u22120.30, 95% CI [\u22120.53, \u22120.08]), internalizing problem behaviors ( d = \u22120.35, 95% CI [\u22120.61, \u22120.08]); and depression and anxiety ( d = \u22120.26, 95% CI [\u22120.40, \u22120.13]). Interventions did not demonstrate any effectiveness for outcomes assessed in the longer term (&gt;6 months). Certainty of effectiveness was limited by risk of bias and imprecision. There was limited available evidence for interventions targeting subjective wellbeing and suicide-related outcomes. Future intervention design and delivery must ensure that programs are sufficient to activate causal mechanisms and facilitate change. Evaluation research should use a robust methodology.

It was hypothesized that participants in the SMA will have greater reductions in A1C at 6 months post-intervention compared to the control group. Methods This study was a quasi-experimental design with a non-randomized matched control group that followed participants prospectively for 6 months. All adults living with type-2 diabetes receiving primary care at a 2 FQHC clinics were eligible for inclusion. Participants in the control group were matched retrospectively on baseline A1C and age. Results The reductions in A1C were greater in the ALDEA SMA intervention group relative to the UPC control group at 6 months in both of the FQHC centers and in the combined sample. Conclusions This study demonstrated that patients in the ALDEA program had a significantly greater reduction in A1C at 6 months compared to the control group. Despite its limitations, the ALDEA SMA program was successful in empowering patients and improving glycemic control.",

      "abstract": "Previous two-nation comparisons have provided evidence that self-efficacy may be a protective factor against depression in individualist cultures, whereas relationship harmony may be a stronger protective factor in collectivist cultures. However, wider sampling and more specific measures of cultural difference are required to test these conclusions. Student ratings of depression and life satisfaction were surveyed in 10 samples drawn from nine nations. Culture-level individualism positively moderated the relationship of self-efficacy to low depression. However, culture-level collectivism negatively moderated the linkage of relationship harmony to depression. To better understand these effects, four separate nation-level predictors derived from dimensions of self-construal were employed. Effects of self-efficacy were strongest where cultural models of selfhood emphasized self-direction (vs. receptiveness to influence); effects of relationship harmony were strongest where cultural models of selfhood emphasized dependence on others (vs. self-reliance). These results illustrate the value of unpackaging the diffusely defined concept of individualism-collectivism.",

      "abstract": "Purpose: Perihaematomal oedema (PHO) formation has gained increasing interest as a therapeutic target after spontaneous intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH). Whether PHO contributes to poor outcome is unclear. We aimed to determine the association between PHO and outcome in patients with spontaneous ICH. Method: We searched five databases up to 17 November 2021 for studies of \u2a7e10 adults with ICH reporting the presence of PHO and outcome. We assessed risk of bias, extracted aggregate data and used random effects meta-analysis to pool studies that reported odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Primary outcome was poor functional outcome defined as modified Rankin Scale score of 3\u20136 at 3 months. Additionally, we assessed PHO growth and poor outcome at any time of follow-up. We prospectively registered the protocol in PROSPERO (CRD42020157088). Findings: We identified 12,968 articles, of which we included 27 studies ( n = 9534). Eighteen studies reported an association between larger PHO volume and poor outcome, six a neutral result and three an inverse relationship. Larger absolute PHO volume was associated with poor functional outcome at 3 months (OR per mL increase of absolute PHO 1.03, 95% CI 1.00\u20131.06, I 2 44%, four studies). Additionally, PHO growth was associated with poor outcome (OR 1.04, 95% CI 1.02\u20131.06, I 2 0%, seven studies). Discussion: In patients with spontaneous ICH, larger PHO volume is associated with poor functional outcome at 3 months. These findings support the development and investigation of new therapeutic interventions targeting PHO formation to evaluate if reduction of PHO improves outcome after ICH.",

      "abstract": "Context: Physical exercise (PE) is an effective treatment for depression, alone or as an adjunct. Objective: There is a lack of indicators regarding the frequency, intensity, duration, and type of physical exercise (PE). This study aims to synthesize and analyze the dose-effect of different PE protocols in adult subjects in the treatment of depression, based on the analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Data Sources: The search was conducted using Web of Science, PubMed, and Cochrane Library electronic databases. Study Selection: Studies with an exercise-based intervention published by December 31, 2021 were identified. RCTs and meta-analyses involving adults with depression were also included; 10 studies were selected, including a total of 956 subjects. Study Design: Systematic review and meta-analysis. Level of Evidence: Level 1. Results: Effect sizes were summarized using standardized mean differences (95% confidence interval) by effected randomized models. The results reinforce that exercise appears to be beneficial in improving depression among adults aged 18 to 65 years. Interventions lasting above 150 minutes per week of moderate intensity and group interventions seem to have a more significant effect on reducing depression. Studies have revealed that aerobic exercise, compared with resistance or flexibility, has a more positive effect on depression. Conclusion: PE can be a way to reduce depression and can be used as a possible adjunctive tool for pharmacological and/or alternative treatments. Considering the findings of this study, it is important that health professionals (eg, exercise physiologists, physicians, nurses, psychologists) promote the practice of PE as a complementary alternative and act early to prevent the worsening of depression.

A rigorous four-step procedure for producing authentic and valid video vignettes is created and implemented. The examined context involves an exploration of stereotypes shared by Hong Kong residents of Mainland Chinese tourists. A total of 10 video vignettes are developed and used as stimuli in 26 semi-structured interviews. Qualitative and quantitative appraisals are conducted to create and test the protocol and quality indicators. Recommendations are made based on the lessons learned from the validation process. The path toward the creation of video vignettes can provide directions for other tourism research inquiries, such as tourist interactions, embodied experiences, and mutual gaze.",

In this study, we explore how communication is used by dentists who provide treatment for adults with intellectual disabilities. A descriptive qualitative study, adopting synchronous online focus groups, was undertaken with six expert dentists in Ireland. Members were contacted again in pairs or individually for further data collection, analysed using thematic content analysis. Two relevant categories emerged from the data, relating to the selection and application of communication-based behaviour support for adults with intellectual disabilities. Decision-making processes were explored. Building on these categories, a co-regulating process of communication emerged as the means by which dentists iteratively apply and adapt communicative strategies. This exploration revealed rationalist and intuitive decision-making. Implications for education, practice and research are identified.",

Relationships with psychological distress and wellbeing, and potential differences in the association between self-compassion and compassion for others by level of psychological distress and wellbeing were also explored. Participants ( n = 811) completed the Spanish adaptations of the Self-Compassion Scale (SCS), the Compassion Scale (CS), the SOCSs (for the self/others), the Short Warwick\u2013Edinburgh Mental Well-Being Scale (SWEMWBS), and the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales-21 (DASS-21). We fitted bifactor models to estimate the general factor of each construct for the different operationalizations, and calculated correlations between them. Relationships between self-compassion and compassion for others from the same operationalization were intermediate, while those between the same constructs from different operationalizations were large. Both constructs showed positive associations with wellbeing, while only self-compassion was associated with decreased psychological distress. Participants with good mental health showed higher associations between self-compassion and compassion for others than those with poorer mental health. Self-compassion and compassion for others appear to be dimensional constructs that can converge or diverge. When they converge, it is associated with better mental health.",

      "abstract": "An online survey (N = 210) is presented on how the perceived utility of correct and exaggerated countermeasures against Covid-19 is affected by different pronominalization strategies (impersonal form, you, we). In evaluating the pronominalization effect, we have statistically controlled for the roles of several personal characteristics: Moral Disengagement, Moral Foundations, Health Anxiety, and Embracing of Fake News. Results indicate that, net of personal proclivities, the you form decreases the perceived utility of exaggerated countermeasures, possibly due to simulation processes. As a second point, through a Structural Equation Model, we show that binding moral values (Authority, Ingroup, and Purity) positively predict both fake news embracing and perceived utility of exaggerated countermeasures, while individualizing moral values (Harm and Fairness) negatively predict fake news embracing and positively predict the perceived utility of correct countermeasures. Lastly, fake news embracing showed a doubly bad effect: not only does it lead people to judge exaggerated countermeasures as more useful; but, more dangerously, it brings them to consider correct countermeasures as less useful in the struggle against the pandemic.",

      "abstract": "Background and purpose Adults lacking capacity are under-represented in research; therefore, the evidence-base surrounding their support needs is inferior compared to other populations. Involving this group in research is fraught with challenges, including researcher uncertainties about how to carry out capacity judgements. Whilst ethical guidelines and principles provide overarching guidance, there is a lack of detailed guidance and evidence-based training, incorporating practical \u2018on the ground\u2019 strategies and advice on communication practices. Experiences and reflections on research procedures used to gauge and address capacity are under reported, resulting in a lack of shared knowledge within the field. Design To help address this, we engaged in researcher (co)meta-reflection on the informed capacity judgement procedure for initial consent, within our current, person-centred dementia intervention feasibility study. Our objective was to identify areas to improve our approach, but to also put forward suggestions for wider change within ethical research practice. Results Findings reveal challenges and facilitators relating to six areas: \u2018Conducting time sensitive research whilst remaining person-centred and building relationships\u2019; \u2018Information sharing and supporting communication\u2019; \u2018Applying the process flexibly\u2019; \u2018The role of the carer and the consultee process\u2019; \u2018Judging assent and dissent\u2019 and \u2018Researcher related factors\u2019. We questioned our \u2018capacity to make capacity judgements\u2019 in terms of both our skills and research time constraints. Conclusions Based on our experiences, we argue for greater open discussion between researchers, Patient and Public Involvement contributors and Research Ethics Committees at initial project planning stages. We recommend training and guidance focuses on building researcher skills in applying a standard process flexibly, emphasising naturalistic, conversational approaches to capacity judgement. A crucial consideration for funders is how this time-intensive and sensitive work should be factored into bid application templates and funding grants. Learnings from this article have potential to inform evidence-based guidance and training for researchers, consultees, funders, reviewers and ethics committees.",

      "title": "Fifteen years with patient choice and free establishment in Swedish primary healthcare: what do we know?",
      "abstract": "Background: In 2007, a reform of Swedish primary healthcare began when some regions implemented enhanced patient choice in combination with free establishment for private providers. Although heavily debated, in 2010 it became mandatory for all regions to implement this choice system. Aim: The aim of this article was to review all published research articles related to the primary healthcare choice reform in Sweden, to investigate what has been published about the reform and summarise its first 15 years. Methods: A scoping review was performed to cover the breadth of research on the reform. Searches were made in Scopus, Web of Science and PubMed for articles published between 2007 and 2021, resulting in 217 unique articles. In total, 52 articles were included. Results: The articles were summarised and presented in relation to six overarching themes: arguments about the primary healthcare choice reform; governance and financial reimbursements; choice of provider and use of information; effects on equity and access; effects on quality; and differences between private and public primary healthcare centres. Conclusions: The articles show that the reform has led to an increase in access to primary healthcare, but most studies indicate that the increase is inequitably distributed in terms of socioeconomy and geographical location. The effects on quality are unclear but several studies show that the mechanisms supposed to lead to quality improvements do not work as intended. Furthermore, from a population health perspective, it is time to discuss how such a responsibility can be reintegrated into primary healthcare and function with the choice system.",

      "title": "Premature Closure of Analysis in Qualitative Research: Identifying Features and Mitigation Strategies",
      "abstract": "Premature closure of analysis refers to finishing data analysis too early, leading to underdeveloped qualitative findings. It is a critical issue in qualitative research affecting the rigor and trustworthiness of qualitative findings. While much has been written about how to conduct rigorous data analysis across a range of qualitative approaches, there has been no discussion of the features of premature closure of analysis and strategies for addressing it. The purpose of this paper is to outline how to spot premature closure of analysis and to describe strategies to mitigate this issue. Three identifying features of premature analysis are: providing thin descriptions with loaded participant quotes, presenting conventional concepts as themes, and using topic summaries as themes. Using a First Approach to qualitative analysis, working in segments to generate a wholistic thematic output, and critical reflection and examination before finalizing the thematic output can be useful strategies to mitigate premature closure of analysis. Themes and patterns that are too vague and meaningless to provide a comprehensive account of the studied phenomenon are a threat to the validity of the study and a waste of researchers\u2019 effort and time. Premature closure of analysis is one of the most common problems affecting the quality of thematic outputs in quality studies. Therefore, researchers should be mindful and critical in their analytical decision-making to prevent this problem.",

      "abstract": "Dominant messages about the capabilities of those with dementia post-diagnosis are often dehumanising and focused on mental declines. Additionally, carers for those with dementia are more likely to be involved in consultations and enquiries about the condition. This study helps to challenge stigmatising cultural messages by reporting upon the experiences of 13 adults diagnosed with early-stage dementia and how their involvement with empowerment groups in Northern Ireland has led to their involvement in consultations with policy makers and educational opportunities with the wider public. The study finds that this not only helps in challenging stereotypical ideas about dementia, as well as informing others, but also gives a sense of purpose to adults in their post-diagnosis lives. It is further noted that group identity helps give confidence and amplifies the voice of those who take part, allowing members to adopt a shared narrative and learn from each other.",

Our search was conducted in April 2021 and utilized the following databases: MEDLINE (PubMed), PsycINFO, SPORTDiscus, CINAHL, Google Scholar, and Clinicaltrials.gov. Forty-two studies ( n = 2,689 participants) with different designs, published between 1979 and 2021, were included. Collectively, results suggest highly variable effects of NBA interventions on depressive symptoms, ranging from reductions in mean depression scores of up to 64% to increases in means scores of up to 18%. Patient adherence to interventions was also variable, and serious adverse events (e.g., leg fractures) did occur. Despite variability across studies, research generally showed that mountain-based and surfing interventions, coupled with other forms of care, may substantially reduce adults\u2019 depressive symptoms more than usual care alone or no intervention, highlighting the potential benefits of some NBA activities for individuals experiencing depressive symptoms.",

Indeed, it is often dismissed as a mere rhetorical device that conspiracists use to give themselves the semblance of science. In this perspective paper, we explore the information-seeking activities (\u201cresearch\u201d) that conspiracists do engage in. Drawing on the experimental psychology of aha experiences, we explain how these activities, as well as the epistemic experiences that precede (curiosity) or follow (insight or \u201caha\u201d experiences) them, may play a crucial role in the appeal and development of conspiracy beliefs. Aha moments have properties that can be exploited by conspiracy theories, such as the potential for false but seemingly grounded conclusions. Finally, we hypothesize that the need for autonomous epistemic agency and discovery is universal but increases as people experience more uncertainty and/or feel epistemically excluded in society, hence linking it to existing literature on explaining conspiracy theories.",

This paper reports on a scoping review of existing literature that deal with trauma aware and informed practice and its applications in arts-health and community arts. Trauma informed practice does not seek to target or treat trauma but, rather, seeks to provide a safer and more informed space for people who experience post-traumatic stress conditions and symptoms to engage in facilitated arts activities. We particularly examine the extent to which existing literature acknowledges the presence of oppression-related collective trauma \u2013 such as racial trauma \u2013 and offers appropriate creative, anti-oppressive and trauma aware practice approaches. A total of 19 articles were included following librarian input and team checking. Included articles were written in English, published in peer reviewed academic journals, included a creative arts component, and adopted an intentional trauma informed or aware approach to practice. An additional three sources were included as part of descriptive synthesis to foreground leading First Nations resources for practice. Although no specific guidelines for trauma aware practice in arts-health or community arts were found, findings are consolidated at the end of the paper to offer interim principles, values and activities for trauma aware and informed practice in arts-health and community arts. Findings can also inform general trauma related research and therapy by highlighting the growing role of arts and creativity in responding to diverse experiences of trauma and its effects.",

      "abstract": "The purpose of these meta-analyses was to examine the effectiveness of home-based interventions aimed at improving literacy and mathematics outcomes for preschool-age children (mean age = 4.29 years; range = 3.07\u20135.32 years) and to develop an understanding of what home-based interventions work in different contexts. A total of 32 studies met the inclusion criteria for these meta-analyses; 30 studies included sufficient data for inclusion in the meta-analyses, and two studies did not contain sufficient quantitative data and instead were summarized in a narrative review. The average weighted effect size for interventions with literacy (d = 0.10; CI = [\u22120.17, 0.38]; n = 27) and mathematical outcomes (d = 0.18; CI = [\u22121.62, 1.99]; n = 8) were minimal. Hence, these meta-analyses showed that home-based interventions had minimal effect on literacy and mathematical outcomes for preschoolers. There were more home-based interventions with literacy (N = 28) than mathematical outcomes (N = 10). The heterogeneity showed no variability, indicating that all intervention impacted on children\u2019s outcomes to similar effect. Overall, many interventions were relatively light touch (i.e., time spent engaging in parent training), and the engagement requirement of the parent in some studies was minimal (e.g., reading a short text message). More in-depth research into the components of interventions (e.g., focus, training approaches) and evaluation of interventions before they are implemented is essential for ensuring that early interventions will be effective and lead to the development of the intended skills.",

In patients with interstitial lung diseases (ILD) frailty is associated with poorer lung function, greater physical impairment, and higher symptom burden. Our understanding of the prevalence of frailty in ILD and consequently its impact on the ILD population is limited. Objective and Methods We aimed to systematically review frailty assessment tools and to determine frailty prevalence across different ILD cohorts. Meta-analyses were used to calculate the pooled prevalence of frailty in the ILD population. Results We identified 26 studies (15 full-texts, 11 conference abstracts) including a total of 4614 patients with ILD. The most commonly used frailty assessment tools were the Fried Frailty Phenotype (FFP), the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB), and the cumulative Frailty Index (FI). Data allowed for meta-analyses of FFP and SPPB prevalence. The pooled prevalence of frailty was 35% (95% CI 25%\u201345%) by FFP, and 19% (95% CI 12%\u201328%) by SPPB. Conclusions Frailty is common in ILD, with considerable variability of frailty prevalence depending on the frailty assessment tool used. These findings highlight the importance of frailty in ILD and the need for a standardized approach to frailty assessment in this population.",

      "abstract": "Objective: The current international trend is to create large datasets with existing data and/or deposit newly collected data into repositories accessible to the scientific community. These practices lead to more efficient data sharing, better detection of small effects, modelling of confounders, establishment of sample generalizability and identification of differences between any given disorders. In Australia, to facilitate such data-sharing and collaborative opportunities, the Neurobiology in Youth Mental Health Partnership was created. This initiative brings together specialised researchers from around Australia to work towards a better understanding of the cross-diagnostic neurobiology of youth mental health and the translation of this knowledge into clinical practice. One of the mandates of the partnership was to develop a protocol for harmonised prospective collection of data across research centres in the field of youth mental health in order to create large datasets. Methods: Four key research modalities were identified: clinical assessments, brain imaging, neurocognitive assessment and collection of blood samples. This paper presents the consensus set of assessments/data collection that has been selected by experts in each domain. Conclusion: The use of this core set of data will facilitate the pooling of psychopathological and neurobiological data into large datasets allowing researchers to tackle important questions requiring very large numbers. The aspiration of this transdiagnostic approach is a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying mental illnesses.",

We aimed to understand perceived barriers and facilitators to the provision of digital sexual health services during the first months of the pandemic. Methods: An online survey and qualitative interviews with UK sexual healthcare professionals recruited online and via snowball sampling were conducted in May\u2013July 2020. Results: Amongst 177 respondents (72% female, 86% White, mean age = 46, SD = 9), most utilised telephone and email as their main communication channels; however, their perceived effectiveness varied (94% and 66%, respectively). Most agreed that staff needed additional training (89%), the available technology was not adequate (66%) and health professionals were hesitant to provide online consultations (46%). They had positive attitudes towards digitalisation, improving service quality and cost-effectiveness but were concerned about exacerbating health inequalities. Discussion: The study identifies a need for clear guidelines and training around the use of digital tools as well as a demand for investment in hardware and software required for the provision of remote services. Future research needs to explore the acceptability, safety and effectiveness of various digital tools to narrow health inequalities in sexual health service users.",

      "abstract": "Violence against youth is a global issue impacting millions each year. Increasingly, research has focused on studying those impacted by multiple forms of violence, or polyvictims. Evidence strongly suggests that polyvictimized youth tend to have worse physical and mental health outcomes than those who have experienced single forms of violence. Moreover, minoritized youth (i.e., racial and/or sexual minority youth, youth with disabilities) are more likely to experience polyvictimization, making this a social justice and equity concern. To date, there is no universal consensus on what exactly constitutes polyvictimization. This systematic review aims to examine the ways in which polyvictimization is being studied to inform both research and practice. As such, relevant databases were searched to amass the extant literature related to youth polyvictimization internationally. Empirical studies published since 2006 that focused on youth (under age 18) polyvictimization were included. After the review process, 264 studies met eligibility criteria, however 55 studies employed person-centered/finite mixture analyses and were removed for a separate review, resulting in 209 featured in the current systematic review. Results demonstrate that researchers are defining and operationalizing polyvictimization in different ways: (a) using individual victimization event counts; (b) employing domain-based counts; and (c) taking a \u201chighest-victimized\u201d percentage of their sample. The most used measurement tool was the Juvenile Victimization Questionnaire, though other validated tools and researcher-constructed questions were frequently utilized. Research on polyvictimization is burgeoning worldwide; however, this research is being conducted in disparate ways, making it difficult to compare findings and further advance the field.",

      "title": "Decentering health research networks: Framing collaboration in the context of narrative incompatibility and regional geo-politics",
      "abstract": "Research innovations and breakthroughs are increasingly realised through collaborative networks amongst state and non-state actors. This article investigates the utilisation of such networks in the field of applied health services research, where policy narratives repeatedly emphasise the importance of collaboration between university researchers, clinical and health service leaders, patient representatives and industry. The translation of policy into practice suggests that these networks are not always designed and managed in line with policy aspirations. Taking a decentred approach, the study reported in this article examines how local policy actors translate national policies for collaborative health research networks in the context of their own histories of applied research, including local narratives and priorities for health research. The study shows that local actors face key dilemmas and opportunities for situated agency, as they experience three competing policy narratives, first, for carrying out world-class research; second, for ensuring research meets local needs and third, for developing new understanding about the implementation of research into practice. Although these expectations might appear coherent to policy-makers, at the regional level, they provide the basis for disagreement and negotiation amongst local policy actors through which the local narrative of collaborative research is framed to regional stakeholders. The study shows how the tensions between elite and local narratives can be reconciled through re-framing activities, especially the articulation of \u2018parallel frames\u2019 within a \u2018cascade framing\u2019 process.",

      "title": "Open notes in psychotherapy: An exploratory mixed methods survey of psychotherapy students in Switzerland",
      "abstract": "Background In a growing number of countries, patients are offered access to their full online clinical records, including the narrative reports written by clinicians (the latter, referred to as \u201copen notes\u201d). Even in countries with mature patient online record access, access to psychotherapy notes is not mandatory. To date, no research has explored the views of psychotherapy trainees about open notes. Objective This study aimed to explore the opinions of psychotherapy trainees in Switzerland about patients\u2019 access to psychotherapists\u2019 free-text summaries. Methods We administered a web-based mixed methods survey to 201 psychotherapy trainees to explore their familiarity with and opinions about the impact on patients and psychotherapy practice of offering patients online access to their psychotherapy notes. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze the 42-item survey, and qualitative descriptive analysis was employed to examine written responses to four open-ended questions. Results Seventy-two (35.8%) trainees completed the survey. Quantitative results revealed mixed views about open notes. 75% agreed that, in general open notes were a good idea, and 94.1% agreed that education about open notes should be part of psychotherapy training. When considering impact on patients and psychotherapy, four themes emerged: (a) negative impact on therapy; (b) positive impact on therapy; (c) impact on patients; and (d) documentation. Students identified concerns related to increase in workload, harm to the psychotherapeutic relationship, and compromised quality of records. They also identified many potential benefits including better patient communication and informed consent processes. In describing impact on different therapy types, students believed that open notes might have differential impact depending on the psychotherapy approaches. Conclusions Sharing psychotherapy notes is not routine but is likely to expand. This mixed methods study provides timely insights into the views of psychotherapy trainees regarding the impact of open notes on patient care and psychotherapy practice.",

      "abstract": "There is a rich body of research addressing the issues of conflict-related sexual violence, and a similar wealth of scholarship focused on resilience. To date, however, these literatures have rarely engaged with each other. This article developed from an ongoing research project that seeks to address this gap, by exploring how victims-/survivors of conflict-related sexual violence in three highly diverse settings \u2013 Bosnia-Herzegovina, Colombia and Uganda \u2013 demonstrate resilience. This research is the first to apply the Adult Resilience Measure (ARM), a 28-item scale that seeks to measure protective resources across individual, relational, and contextual subscales, to the context of conflict-related sexual violence. A total of 449 female and male participants in the three aforementioned countries completed the ARM (in the framework of the study questionnaire) as part of this research. This article presents some of the results of the analyses. Specifically, we first sought to establish through Confirmatory Factor Analysis whether the ARM was actually measuring the same construct in all three countries, by confirming the invariance (or otherwise) of the factor structure. The second aim was to explore how different resources function and cluster in different cultural contexts, to arrive at a more nuanced understanding of the different protective factors in the lives of study participants. We generated different factor structures for BiH, Colombia, and Uganda respectively, suggesting that a single factor structure does not sufficiently capture the diverse groupings of protective factors linked to the particularities of each country, including the dynamics of the conflicts themselves. Ultimately, we use the findings to underscore the need for policy approaches that move away from a deficit model and give greater attention to strengthening and investing in the (often overlooked) protective resources that victims-/survivors may already have in their everyday lives.",

We aimed to address this gap. Method: We used data ( n = 1,204) from a longitudinal birth cohort study spanning eight countries to address this gap. Results: ADHD symptoms in the third trimester of pregnancy were associated with lower social support from family ( b = \u22120.16, p = .031), friends ( b = \u22120.16, p = .024), and significant others ( b = \u22120.09, p = .001); higher stress ( b = 0.34, p &lt; .001) and depressive symptoms ( b = 0.31, p &lt; .001), and increased likelihood of an unwanted pregnancy ( b = 0.30, p = .009). Significant associations with tobacco use ( b = 0.36, p = .023) and premature birth ( b = 0.35, p = .007) did not survive correction for multiple comparisons and there were no significant associations with alcohol use, low birth weight, or unplanned pregnancy. Conclusion: Results suggest that women with ADHD symptoms could benefit from earlier, more regular screening for mental health difficulties and greater mental health support during pregnancy.",

      "abstract": "Implementation of human resource management (HRM) practices in Iran has been patchy and unenthusiastic despite them having been found to be beneficial in Western countries. To investigate this problem, survey data were gathered from 63 private sector organizations in Iran, producing 325 usable responses, and were analysed using structural equation modelling. Our findings unexpectedly show that transactional leadership had a similar impact on balanced organizational culture to transformational leadership. Also, no relationship was found between balanced organizational culture and team working, or between team working and job satisfaction, which contradicts previous research. We argue that, in HR departments in Iran, culturally generated attitudes towards aspects of HRM itself may produce low job satisfaction, and thus may compromise the implementation of HRM practices. We also argue that, since the cultural conditions that create these anomalies are common to other Middle Eastern and Southern Asian countries, our results can be generalized to these regions. Based on these findings, recommendations are made for practitioners.",

Experiences resulting from such difficulties include increased listening effort and fatigue. Social interactions may become less appealing in the context of such experiences, and age-related hearing loss is associated with an increased risk of social isolation and associated negative psychosocial health outcomes. However, the precise relationship between age-related hearing loss and social isolation is not well described. Here, we review the literature and synthesize existing work from different domains to propose a framework with three conceptual anchor stages to describe the relation between hearing loss and social isolation: within-situation disengagement from listening, social withdrawal, and social isolation. We describe the distinct characteristics of each stage and suggest potential interventions to mitigate negative impacts of hearing loss on social lives and health. We close by outlining potential implications for researchers and clinicians.",

      "abstract": "A practical speech audiometry tool is the digits-in-noise (DIN) test for hearing screening of populations of varying ages and hearing status. The test is usually conducted by a human supervisor (e.g., clinician), who scores the responses spoken by the listener, or online, where software scores the responses entered by the listener. The test has 24-digit triplets presented in an adaptive staircase procedure, resulting in a speech reception threshold (SRT). We propose an alternative automated DIN test setup that can evaluate spoken responses whilst conducted without a human supervisor, using the open-source automatic speech recognition toolkit, Kaldi-NL. Thirty self-reported normal-hearing Dutch adults (19\u201364 years) completed one DIN + Kaldi-NL test. Their spoken responses were recorded and used for evaluating the transcript of decoded responses by Kaldi-NL. Study 1 evaluated the Kaldi-NL performance through its word error rate (WER), percentage of summed decoding errors regarding only digits found in the transcript compared to the total number of digits present in the spoken responses. Average WER across participants was 5.0% (range 0\u201348%, SD = 8.8%), with average decoding errors in three triplets per participant. Study 2 analyzed the effect that triplets with decoding errors from Kaldi-NL had on the DIN test output (SRT), using bootstrapping simulations. Previous research indicated 0.70 dB as the typical within-subject SRT variability for normal-hearing adults. Study 2 showed that up to four triplets with decoding errors produce SRT variations within this range, suggesting that our proposed setup could be feasible for clinical applications.",

However, caring can detrimentally affect carers\u2019 health and wellbeing, thus policy advocates for improved carer support. Objective: to establish the published international evidence base regarding interventions for carers delivered by occupational therapists. Method English language studies published January 2010\u2013January 2021 were identified against predetermined inclusion/exclusion criteria via searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsychINFO, OTSeeker, Scopus, Web of Science and the Cochrane Library. Supplemental strategies: database alerts, hand-searching, searching of included papers\u2019 reference lists and citations, and contacting key authors. Two reviewers completed critical appraisal and produced a textual narrative synthesis of data using a convergent integrated method. Results 38 papers were included, reporting 21 interventions. Most were dyadic, home-based interventions for carers of people living with dementia. Common intervention components included: assessment and goal-setting, skill training, education, coping strategies, equipment provision, environmental adaptation and signposting. Interventions improved outcomes for carers, however, intervention design and evaluation require careful consideration to maximise carer benefits and capture intervention effects. Conclusion Occupational therapist delivered carer interventions enhance support and improve carer outcomes. Intervention and evaluation designs should include careful selection of outcome measures, avoidance of increased carer burden in dyadic interventions and acknowledgement of known barriers and facilitators to both carer and therapist intervention engagement.",

Adolescents with and without ADHD did not differ in the number of friends they nominated, the duration of their friendships, and the frequency of contact with friends. Adolescents with ADHD were more likely to have friends who were younger or older by two or more years and close friends with behavior problems than comparison adolescents. Girls with ADHD had fewer of their friendships corroborated by parents than girls without ADHD, and fewer of their best friends attending their school. Only girls with ADHD had friends whom they initially met online.",

      "abstract": "Pharmacovigilance is essential for protecting patient health by monitoring and managing medication-related risks. Traditional methods like spontaneous reporting systems and clinical trials are valuable for identifying adverse drug events, but face delays in data access. Social media platforms, with their real-time data, offer a novel avenue for pharmacovigilance by providing a wealth of user-generated content on medication usage, adverse drug events, and public sentiment. However, the unstructured nature of social media content presents challenges in data analysis, including variability and potential biases. Advanced techniques like natural language processing and machine learning are increasingly being employed to extract meaningful information from social media data, aiding in early adverse drug event detection and real-time medication safety monitoring. Ensuring data reliability and addressing ethical considerations are crucial in this context. This review examines the existing literature on the use of social media data for drug safety analysis, highlighting the platforms involved, methodologies applied, and research questions explored. It also discusses the challenges, limitations, and future directions of this emerging field, emphasizing the need for ethical principles, transparency, and interdisciplinary collaboration to maximize the potential of social media in enhancing pharmacovigilance efforts.",

      "abstract": "According to the Hindustani music tradition, the ability of a song to induce certain emotions depends on the time of day: playing a song at the right time is said to maximise its emotional effect. The present exploratory study investigated this claim by combining findings in chronobiology, mood research and music perception. It has already been established that some aspects of our mood fluctuations follow a cyclical pattern. Besides, it is a known fact that our current mood influences our perception and assessment of emotions. However, these elements have never been linked together in a study examining the effect of mood cyclicity on perceived emotions in music. To test the hypothesis of a link between the two, Western film music excerpts were played to 36 participants at two different times (9 a.m. and 4 p.m.). Their task was to rate the perceived emotional content of each clip. The results showed that sad and tender clips were rated higher on sadness and tenderness in the morning compared to the afternoon. Furthermore, the more tired the participants were in the afternoon, the higher was their perception of fear in angry and fearful music. Although the reported effect sizes were small, these findings could have important implications for ethnomusicologists, emotion researchers and music therapists.",

      "abstract": "Many autistic youths experience restricted school participation. The present study investigated the influences of youth, family and school factors on autistic youths\u2019 school participation. Parents of 200 Dutch autistic youths (age range: 4\u201316 years, M age = 12.23 years, SD age = 2.93 years) filled in questionnaires in a national survey for autistic individuals, reporting the school participation, age and autistic traits of their child, parents\u2019 education level and self-efficacy for supporting their child\u2019s schoolwork, and the impact of problems their child experienced with the physical and social environments of the school. Multivariate linear regression analysis using imputed data revealed that among the six predictor variables, only the impact of problems autistic youths experienced with the physical environment of school was negatively associated with their school participation. This study provided support for the essential role of the school environment in predicting autistic youths\u2019 school participation, indicating that problematic aspects in the school environment could have a greater impact on autistic youths\u2019 school participation than youth factors or family factors. This highlights the need to create a more accommodating environment at school, where autistic youths can participate easily and comfortably. Lay abstract School-aged youths have a basic human right to participate in educational and recreational activities at school. Yet, autistic youths are at high risk of being excluded from school and from school-based activities. It is important to understand how this occurs, to ensure that all autistic youths have opportunities to participate in school activities that are equal to the opportunities of their non-autistic peers. The present study investigated multiple influences on the school participation of autistic youths, including youth factors (age and autistic traits), family factors (parent education level and parental self-efficacy for supporting their child\u2019s schoolwork) and school factors (the impact of problems autistic youths experienced with the physical and social environments of school). Using an online survey, we gathered the views and experiences of the parents of 200 autistic youths aged between 4 and 16 years, in the Netherlands. We found that among the factors, only the impact of problems that autistic youths experienced with the physical environment of school was associated with their school participation. In particular, autistic youths who experienced greater difficulties with the physical environment of school had lower levels of school participation. Our findings highlight the pressing need to modify school environments to better accommodate the needs of autistic youths so that they can participate easily and comfortably.",

This study applies discourse analysis and conversation analysis to transcripts of 12 video-recordings of groupwork sessions for addressing sexual offending, examining how desistance narratives and identities are produced, and how practitioner skills and conversational styles intersect with their production. The analysis illustrates how criminal justice practitioners help to co-author desistance narratives through subtle and explicit aspects of interaction, although certain orientations to risk may limit this potential.",

CFA confirmed this model, and MCFA showed full measurement invariance (configural, metric. and scalar) across the groups in the different comparisons. For all comparisons, there were equivalencies for latent mean scores. The implications of the findings for clinical and research practice involving the SDQ in Malaysia are discussed.",

      "abstract": "Dynamically predicting patient survival probabilities using longitudinal measurements has become of great importance with routine data collection becoming more common. Many existing models utilize a multi-step landmarking approach for this problem, mostly due to its ease of use and versatility but unfortunately most fail to do so appropriately. In this article we make use of multivariate functional principal component analysis to summarize the available longitudinal information, and employ a Cox proportional hazards model for prediction. Additionally, we consider a centred functional principal component analysis procedure in an attempt to remove the natural variation incurred by the difference in age of the considered subjects. We formalize the difference between a \u2018relaxed\u2019 landmarking approach where only validation data is landmarked and a \u2018strict\u2019 landmarking approach where both the training and validation data are landmarked. We show that a relaxed landmarking approach fails to effectively use the information contained in the longitudinal outcomes, thereby producing substantially worse prediction accuracy than a strict landmarking approach.",

      "abstract": "Purpose: To assess differences in mental health screening based on patient\u2019s preferred language. Methods: For this retrospective cohort study, data for 85 725 unique patients from 10 primary care clinics in West Michigan were analyzed if patients received at least 1 mental health screening with the Patient Health Questionnaire 4 (PHQ-4) within a 12-month period (10/15/2021-10/14/2022). A general linear regression model was used to assess the adjusted odds ratios (aOR) of being screened. Results: Patients having a preferred language other than English (n = 2755) had an 87.0% chance of receiving the recommended mental health screening, compared to 76.7% of English-speaking patients ( P &lt; .001). A multivariable model revealed decreased screening odds for Kinyarwanda (aOR 0.29, 95% CI 0.19-0.45) and Persian/Dari/Pashto (aOR 0.46, 95% CI 0.23-0.91) speaking patients and higher screening odds for Spanish (aOR 1.45, 95% CI 1.19-1.77), Bosnian (aOR 2.13, 95% CI 1.11-4.11), and Vietnamese (aOR 2.25 95% CI 1.64-3.08) speaking patients compared to English speaking patients. Conclusions: Results highlight the inequities between the language groups that are probably the result of the challenges to access multilingual depression and anxiety screening instruments. Furthermore, providers may be prone to bias about who they think \u201cneeds\u201d a mental health screening. We suggest that measures are implemented to ensure consistency in mental health screening regardless of a patients\u2019 preferred language.",

      "abstract": "Introduction There is limited understanding of the cultural needs of diverse Black and Minority Ethnic populations such as South Asian older adults, which may be perpetuating occupational injustices and health inequalities faced by these groups. Although cultural considerations are intrinsic to person-centred occupational therapy and increasingly relevant to the changing landscape of health and social care, the profession is criticised for its western-centric focus. This study aimed to gain understanding of the current cross-cultural issues in supporting South Asian older adults in the UK, as perceived by occupational therapists. Method A constructivist qualitative design supported by thematic analysis was used, involving seven occupational therapists in the United Kingdom who participated in semi-structured interviews via Skype/telephone. Findings Cross-cultural issues were illustrated through the following themes: \u2018when the barriers go down\u2019 \u2013 cultural mismatch in individualist vs. collectivist worldviews; \u2018invasion of the family home\u2019 \u2013 cultural inappropriateness of standard interventions; and \u2018I go into every assessment assuming nothing\u2019 \u2013 recognition of and response to challenges. Conclusion This study provides insight into cross-cultural issues in occupational therapy for South Asian older adults, revealing a gap between theory and practice in integrating cultural humility.

      "abstract": "This research aims to advance the understanding of gamification in health care management using a systematic review of the literature through a multiphase analysis. To do so, first, we extract the relevant bibliographic data for our research according to a methodology of data generation structured in six stages and a descriptive analysis oriented to the technical characterization of the data. Then, we codify all the information, identify the main attributes with the collaboration of two independent experts and check their validity using the evaluation of two focus groups of professionals in gamification and health care management. We found seven attributes: (1) health care users, (2) psychology, (3) behavior, (4) activities, (5) health field, (6) technology, and (7) gamification elements. Within each of these seven attributes, there are a series of main elements that are detailed in the following for each of them. (1) Health care users: their age and the role they play in the health system. (2) Psychology: cognition, positive and negative emotions. (3) Behavior: healthy behavior encouragement, such as compliance, collaboration and responsibility. (4) Activities: physical activity and food. (5) Health field: preventive medicine and chronic diseases. (6) Technology: cell phones. (7) Gamification elements: different elements, but the number of articles in which these elements and their interactions are studied in depth is limited. Our results point toward a promising present and future research agenda that is in parallel with the development of relevant fields for the sector, such as chronic diseases, health education and preventive medicine.",

      "abstract": "A cochlear implant (CI) is a prosthesis that allows people with severe to profound hearing loss to understand speech in quiet settings. However, listening to music presents a challenge to most CI users; they often do not enjoy music or avoid it altogether. The Musi-CI training course was developed for CI users with the goal of reducing music aversion and improving music enjoyment. A consortium was established consisting of a professional musician with CI, CI rehabilitation professionals and researchers. Participatory action research (PAR) was applied to develop and evaluate the training experiences, collaborating with 37 CI users during three cycles of eight training sessions, each held over a period of 3 months. Input and feedback were collected after each training session using questionnaires, observations and focus group interviews. Almost all participants (86%) completed the training. After completing the training a large majority of participants reported increased music appreciation, increased social participation in musical settings and a positive impact on general auditory perception. The resulting Musi-CI training programme focuses on music listening skills, self-efficacy, and self-motivation. It consists of exercises intended to strengthen attention and working memory, to improve beat and rhythm perception (with online rhythm exercises) and exercises to distinguish timbre of instruments and emotion in music. A Melody Game was developed to improve pitch and melodic contour discrimination.",

      "abstract": "Increasing evidence highlights the role of disrupted circadian rhythms in the neural dysfunctions and sleep disturbances observed in autism spectrum disorder and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. However, the causality and directionality of these associations remain unclear. In this study, we employed a bidirectional two-sample Mendelian randomization framework, leveraging genome-wide association study data from the UK Biobank ( n = 85,670) and FinnGen ( n = 377,277). Genetic variants served as instrumental variables to infer causation, and objective accelerometer-derived metrics identified circadian rhythm and sleep genetic instruments. The results showed that the timing of the most active 10 h was significantly linked to higher odds of autism spectrum disorder and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Independently, higher sleep efficiency predicted a lower risk of autism spectrum disorder, while attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder was linked to an increase in nocturnal sleep episodes. Heterogeneity and sensitivity analyses confirmed these findings. Our study establishes causal links between circadian alterations and autism spectrum disorder and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, distinguishing the independent and protective role of sleep efficiency in autism spectrum disorder from circadian rhythms. In attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, however, disrupted sleep appears as a consequence, not a cause. These insights highlight divergent interactions with sleep factors in autism spectrum disorder and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, laying the groundwork for tailored therapeutic strategies that recognize the distinct influences of sleep quality and circadian rhythms in each disorder. Lay abstract Research shows that people with autism spectrum disorder and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder often have sleep issues and problems with the body\u2019s natural daily rhythms, known as circadian rhythms. By exploring the genetic variants associated with these rhythms and the conditions, this study reveals that these rhythm changes and sleep patterns are directly linked to autism spectrum disorder and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. It found that the timing of one\u2019s most active hours can increase the likelihood of having both autism spectrum disorder and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Importantly, it also shows that good sleep quality might protect against autism spectrum disorder, while disturbed sleep in people with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder seems to be a result rather than the cause of the condition. This understanding can help doctors and researchers develop better treatment approaches that focus on the specific ways sleep and body rhythms affect those with autism spectrum disorder and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, considering their unique associations with circadian rhythms and sleep patterns. Understanding these unique links can lead to more effective, personalized care for those affected by these conditions.",

This mixed-method study aimed to investigate the effects of self-selected music on students\u2019 mood, motivation, concentration, and learning success in a real-life school context. Forty-eight secondary school students (age range: 15\u201319) completed the study, and both quantitative and qualitative data were collected. The study consisted of two phases: one week of regular lessons without music and a subsequent week in which students listened to self-selected music before each lesson. The results showed that listening to music had strong positive effects on mood, motivation, and concentration, and moderate effects on learning. Qualitative analysis of open-ended questions revealed that the beneficial effects were mostly perceived to be due to creating positive and energizing emotions, increasing attention, and providing routine and rest between lessons. The findings suggest that listening to self-selected music could be an effective and low-cost strategy for enhancing students\u2019 emotional state, motivation, and concentration in a school context.",

Yet we have a limited understanding of how survivors relate to their political environment after the conflict ends. We analyze individual-level survey data on postwar Sri Lanka to assess whether wartime sexual victimization relates to political activism. Connecting unobtrusive measures from a list experiment to individual survivors\u2019 political action, we show that personal experience of sexual violence increases political participation. This effect is substantial in size, holds for institutionalized and non-institutionalized forms of political action, and is robust to unobserved confounding or sample selection bias. Causal mediation analyses suggest that survivors of wartime sexual violence mobilize politically through their involvement in civic networks. The findings stress the relevance of survivors\u2019 agency and contribute to a better understanding of wartime sexual violence, the role of civil society in post-conflict politics, and of humanitarian policy.",

Additionally, we explored associations with suicidal ideation. Across seven countries ( N = 2408) we found that self-respect and depressive symptoms were negatively correlated. In addition, we found evidence for an indirect path via assertiveness as well as negative correlations with suicidal ideation in countries with available measures. Finally, within-manuscript meta-analyses confirmed the main path between self-respect and depressive symptoms across all seven countries.

      "abstract": "Adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) is lower in adolescents with HIV (AWH) than in any other age group, partly due to self-regulatory challenges during development. Mindfulness and acceptance training have been shown to support psychological flexibility, a self-regulatory skill that potentially improves adolescent adherence to medication. We assessed the effect of weekly group-based mindfulness and acceptance training sessions on ART adherence among older adolescents (15\u201319 years) in Kampala, Uganda. One hundred and twenty-two AWH (median age 17, range 15\u201319 years, 57% female) receiving care at a public health facility in Kampala were randomized 1:1 to receive 4 weekly 90-min group sessions facilitated by experienced trainers or standard-of-care ART services. The training involved (Session 1) clarifying values, (Session 2) skillfully relating to thoughts, (Session 3) allowing and becoming aware of experiences non-judgmentally, and (Session 4) exploring life through trial and error. At baseline, postintervention, and 3-month follow-up, psychological flexibility was measured using the Avoidance and Fusion Questionnaire for Youth (AFQ-Y8), and self-reported ART adherence was assessed using the Morisky Medication Adherence Scale (MMAS-8). At baseline, the intervention and standard-of-care arms had similar psychological flexibility (AFQ-Y8 score:15.45 \u00b1 0.82; 15.74 \u00b1 0.84) and ART adherence (MMAS-8 score: 5.32 \u00b1 0.24; 5.13 \u00b1 0.23). Retention through the study was moderate (71%). Completion of mindfulness and acceptance training was associated with a significant reduction in psychological inflexibility at the 3-month follow-up (AFQ-Y8 score: 12.63 \u00b1 1.06; 14.05 \u00b1 1.07, P = .006). However, no significant differences were observed in self-reported adherence to ART at the 3-month follow-up (MMAS-8 score: 5.43 \u00b1 0.23; 4.90 \u00b1 0.33, P = .522). Group-based mindfulness and acceptance training improved psychological flexibility in this population of adolescents on ART in Uganda but did not significantly improve ART adherence. Future research should explore integrated approaches that combine behavioral management training with other empowerment aspects to improve ART adherence among AWH.",

These findings point to a need for interventions to reduce these difficulties. The purpose of the present study was to assess the effects of 2 formats of an innovative program on students\u2019 mental health (anxiety, depressive symptoms, and academic burnout), intolerance of uncertainty, learned helplessness, and learning. Our sample was composed of 105 university students, recruited on a voluntary basis. They were divided into 3 groups: online intervention group (n = 36), face-to-face intervention group (n = 32), and control group (n = 37). The following variables were measured through online questionnaires: anxiety and depressive symptoms, academic burnout, intolerance of uncertainty, learned helplessness, perceived social support, learning strategies, and beliefs. There were 2 assessments 10 weeks apart (ie, before and after the program in the case of the 2 intervention groups). We performed nonparametric analyses to run comparisons between the 2 assessment timepoints in each group. Results showed that participants in the 2 intervention groups had lower levels of learned helplessness and intolerance of uncertainty at the end of the program. Furthermore, participants in the face-to-face group reported higher levels of perceived social support, academic self-efficacy, and help-seeking strategies. The present study highlighted the benefits of our innovative program, especially its face-to-face format. Clinical Trial - ID: NCT04978194.",

We conducted systematic searches for articles published between January 2010 and December 2015 in five databases: Cochrane, MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and Web of Science. Forty original studies were found that met the inclusion criteria: self-management with diabetes ( n = 29), cardiovascular diseases ( n = 8), and those at risk of cardiovascular diseases ( n = 3). These consisted of 22 randomized controlled trials and 18 other trials, with durations of 1 day to 24 months. The findings showed that the training of LHWs and the implementation of interventions varied widely. A synthesis of the implementation methods covers the background of the LHWs and the interventions as well as the components applied in each. Eight interventions had effects on physical activity and eight on nutrition behavior. The review also includes preliminary findings on intervention components effective in improving physical activity and nutrition behavior, including self-monitoring as a behavior change technique and group meetings as an intervention format. The same components and behavior change techniques were applied in effective and noneffective interventions. The review found that LHW-led interventions have potential in promoting self-management in long-term condition. In the future, a qualified and evidence-based structure for LHW-led interventions is suggested in order to improve the systematization of interventions and their effects.",

      "abstract": "Background: Addictive disorders are significant global public health burdens. Treatment uptake with these disorders is low and outcomes can be mixed. Electronic screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment (e-SBIRT) programs have potential to improve uptake and treatment outcomes. To date, however, no prior review of the literature has been conducted to gauge the effectiveness of e-SBIRT for addictive disorders. Methods: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature concerning e-SBIRT for addictive disorders by surveying the MEDLINE, PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, Embase, and PsycInfo databases on January 17, 2023. Results: Ten articles were included at analysis reporting evaluation of e-SBIRT interventions for substance use disorders including alcohol use in a variety of settings. No articles were identified regarding treatment for behavioral addictions such as disordered/harmful gambling. Meta-analysis found e-SBIRT to be effective at reducing drinking frequency in the short term only. e-SBIRT was not found to be advantageous over control conditions for abstinence or other treatment outcomes. We identified and described common components of e-SBIRT programs and assessed the quality of available evidence, which was generally poor. Conclusion: The present findings suggest that research regarding e-SBIRT is concentrated exclusively on higher-risk substance use. There is a lack of consensus regarding the effectiveness of e-SBIRT for addictive disorders. Although common features exist, e-SBIRT designs are variable, which complicates identification of the most effective components. Overall, the quality of outcome evidence is low, and furthermore, high-quality experimental treatment evaluation research is needed.",

      "abstract": "This article explores the circulation of \u2018anti-psychiatry\u2019 in British film and television during the long 1960s, focusing on the controversial BBC television play In Two Minds (1967) and its cinema remake Family Life (1971). These films were inspired by R. D. Laing's ideas on the aetiology of schizophrenia, and were understood as uniting the personal and political motivations of progressive film-makers (Ken Loach, Tony Garnett, David Mercer) and progressive psychiatrists (Laing, David Cooper, Aaron Esterson). Drawing upon practitioner interviews with producer Garnett and director Loach, and extensive archival research on the production and reception of these films , this article contests previous scholarship on the popular circulation of anti-psychiatry and the movement's perceived polarisation from mainstream British psychiatry. While the reception of In Two Minds and Family Life did intensify an adversarial relationship between \u2018rebel\u2019 anti-psychiatrists and hard-line behaviourists such as William Sargant, the wider psychiatric field largely welcomed the films' contributions to mental health awareness and used the publicity to counter the idea of a \u2018battle\u2019 within the profession. This included leading UK mental health organisation the National Association for Mental Health looking to Loach and Laing as models for engaging contemporary audiences as it rebranded to MIND in 1972 . This article contributes to historical understandings of the complex interactions between the fields of media and mental health, as well as recent scholarship challenging the idea of a clear split between anti-psychiatry and British medical orthodoxy.",

      "title": "Early trajectories and moderators of autistic language profiles: A longitudinal study in preschoolers",
      "abstract": "Both expressive and receptive language difficulties in autism emerge early and significantly have an impact on social functioning and quality of life. Despite their wide heterogeneity, autistic language abilities can be stratified into three distinct profiles. Language unimpaired exhibit near-typical verbal performance, language impaired show significant alterations in language structure, and minimally verbal display limited verbal abilities. However, little is known about the early trajectories and moderators specific to each profile. Here, we used a longitudinal sample of 286 preschoolers with autism and 85 typically developing (aged 1.5\u20135.7 years old), yielding 1164 visits. Our cluster analysis replicated the three well-established autistic language profiles (language unimpaired, n = 86; language impaired, n = 85; minimally verbal, n = 44) and revealed their specific early trajectories in expressive vocabulary, syntax, and pragmatics. At age 2.4, non-verbal cognition moderated the participants\u2019 attribution to each language profile. Moreover, early stereotyped language specifically moderated the later verbal performance of language unimpaired participants, while the language outcome of language impaired participants was moderated by early intensive behavioral intervention. In conclusion, we provided a fine-grained description of language acquisition trajectories and moderators of autistic language profiles in a longitudinal sample exposed to French language, paving the way toward personalized medicine to autistic language difficulties. Lay Abstract Language development can greatly vary among autistic children. Children who struggle with language acquisition often face many challenges and experience lower quality of life. However, little is known about the early language trajectories of autistic preschoolers and their moderators. Autistic language can be stratified into three profiles. Language unimpaired experience little to no language difficulties; language impaired show significant difficulties in language; minimally verbal never develop functional language. In this study, we used a longitudinal sample of preschoolers with autism and with typical development (aged 1.5\u20135.7 years). We replicated the three language profiles through a data-driven approach. We also found that different factors modulated the language outcome within each group. For instance, non-verbal cognition at age 2.4 moderated the participants\u2019 attribution to each language profile. Moreover, early intervention moderated verbal outcome in the language impaired profile. In conclusion, we provided a detailed description of how autistic preschoolers acquire language, and what factors might influence their trajectories. Our findings could inspire more personalized intervention for early autistic language difficulties.",

      "abstract": "Despite being a core psychological construct for over 70 years, research has yet to examine how perceptions of deprivation relative to other individuals and/or groups develop across adulthood. As such, this preregistered study uses cohort-sequential latent growth modeling to examine changes in individual- and group-based relative deprivation (IRD and GRD, respectively) across the adult lifespan. Across 10 annual assessments of a nationwide random sample of adults ( N total = 58,878; ethnic minority n = 11,927; 62.7% women; ages 21\u201380), mean levels of IRD trended downward across the lifespan, whereas mean levels of GRD generally increased from young-to-middle adulthood before declining across late adulthood. Subtle cohort effects emerged for both constructs, although both IRD and GRD largely followed a normative aging process. Critically, the development of GRD\u2014but not IRD\u2014differed between ethnic groups, providing insights into how one\u2019s objective status may shape subjective (dis)advantage over time.",

      "abstract": "Introduction: Mentorship is perceived as a mechanism to enhance career progression. Within occupational therapy, there is little research to demonstrate the effectiveness of mentoring on career success and no research has explored its relevance for black and minoritised ethnic (BME) occupational therapists. This research explored the experience of mentoring for career progression from a BME perspective using a survey. Methods: An online survey was conducted with occupational therapists in the United Kingdom who identified as BME. The primary recruitment method was a convenience sample via a BME network and through its other links. Content analysis and descriptive statistics were used to analyse and report the data. Findings: In all, 54 BME occupational therapists completed the survey. Most BME therapists had never requested a BME mentor, but most wanted a BME mentor. Active allyship was viewed as an important part of mentorship when mentored by a white therapist. Conclusion: This research is the first study in occupational therapy to examine the mentoring experiences and needs of BME therapists. It is a call for action to recognise and reorient the approach and understanding of the structures and experiences of BME mentorship.",

It is an infectious disease with a high incidence and mortality rate. The spread of the disease is also a significant threat to human health, especially in the developing world. This study suggests a method called shuffle shepherd optimization-based generalized deep convolutional fuzzy network (SSO-GDCFN) to diagnose the COVID-19 disease state, types, and recovered categories. The results show that the accuracy of the proposed method is as high as 99.99%; similarly, precision is 99.98%; sensitivity/recall is 100%; specificity is 95%; kappa is 0.965%; AUC is 0.88%; and MSE is less than 0.07% as well as 25 s. Moreover, the performance of the suggested method has been confirmed by comparison of the simulation results from the proposed approach with those from several traditional techniques. The experimental findings demonstrate strong performance and high accuracy for categorizing COVID-19 stages with minimal reclassifications over the conventional methods.",

      "abstract": "Objectives We aimed to assess associations between depressive symptoms, lifestyle, and somatic symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic. Design A prospective, observational study using a self-designed questionnaire. Setting Three general practitioners\u2019 (GP) offices in rural Germany. Participants 271 adult patients without manifest cardiovascular or pulmonary disease with (n = 82) and without (n = 189) hypertension reporting to our GP offices. Main outcome measures The reported increase of depressive symptoms (loneliness, sleeplessness, joylessness, listlessness) prior to the first documented case in Germany on 27.01.2020 (t 0 ) as opposed to patients\u2019 health perception during the Corona pandemic (t 1 ) was the primary outcome measure. The secondary outcome measures were changes in physical activity (PA), dyspnea and angina in the two groups. Results Out of 271 patients (50.8 \u00b1 16.8 years, 55.1% females), 1.5% were tested positive for COVID-19. Overall, listlessness (8.5%, p = 0.001), sleeplessness (5.2%, p = 0.001) and joylessness (4.2%, p = 0.003) were increased. Dyspnea significantly increased (9.2%, p &lt; 0.001) and employment status worsened (6.5%, p &lt; 0.001). There were significant associations between the increase of depressive symptoms, weight increase (p = 0.017), and reduction in physical activity (p = 0.046). However, after adjusting for age, hypertensive patients did not show more depressive symptoms (p = 0.704), dyspnea (p = 0.063) or angina (p = 0.432), nor was there any difference in PA (p = 0.906) compared to healthy individuals. Conclusions We demonstrate an association between the deterioration of depressive symptoms, weight gain, and reduced physical activity during COVID-19, both in hypertensives and healthy controls. Hypertension is no driver of symptom deterioration during the pandemic. The trial was registered in the German Clinical Trials Registry (DRKS00022157).",

However, cultural and lifestyle variations create country-specific health differences. This meta-analysis assessed the prevalence of preterm birth (PTB) and its categories in Scandinavian countries. Methods A systematic search in key databases of literature published between 1990 and 2021 identified studies of the prevalence of PTB and its categories. Following the use of the Freeman\u2013Tukey double arcsine transformation, a meta-analysis of weighted data was performed using the random-effects model and meta-prop method. Results We identified 109 observational studies that involved 86,420,188 live births. The overall pooled prevalence (PP) of PTB was 5.3% (PP = 5.3%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 5.1%, 5.5%). The highest prevalence was in Norway (PP = 6.2%, 95% CI 5.3%, 7.0%), followed by Sweden (PP = 5.3%, 95% CI 5.1%, 5.4%), Denmark (PP = 5.2%, 95% CI 4.9%, 5.3%), and Iceland (PP = 5.0%, 95% CI 4.4%, 5.7%).

More sophisticated relationships between so-called \"innate\" and \"acquired\" determinants of behavior are discussed, along with the proper relevance of animal behavior studies for human behavior. Unless contained in a comprehensive theory which includes social and psychological variables, biolog ically oriented theories (although often valid within their domain) offer at best severely limited and at worst highly misleading explanations of complex social conflicts.

Seeking treatment is further complicated for immigrant parents whose cultural backgrounds may influence their understanding of mental health. This analysis uses qualitative data from [MASKED], which is a representative study of newly immigrated youth (12\u201318 years) and their parents, to examine parental perceptions of mental health and to determine patterns of help seeking and service use. Sixteen parents participated in semistructured qualitative interviews that used vignettes to elicit parental beliefs about adolescent behavior and mental health. Findings suggest parents 1) identify behavior that meets diagnostic criteria as problematic; 2) ascribe those behaviors to a range of etiologies; and 3) desire to intervene. Two areas of service delivery emerged as problematic: many parents expect services delivered in ways that conflict with current practice standards, and new immigrant families often encounter cultural and practical barriers to accessing care.",

In this empirical study, we evaluate the impact of several communication formats on the interpretation of measurement accuracy and its influence on the decision-making process in clinical practice. We provided 230 clinical practitioners with score reports in five formats: textual, error bar, violin plot, diamond plot, and quantile dot plot. We found that quantile dot plots significantly increased accuracy in the assessment of measurement uncertainty compared with other formats. However, a direct relation between visualization format and decision quality could not be found. Although traditional confidence intervals and error bars were favored by many participants due to their familiarity, responses revealed several misconceptions that make the suitability of these formats for communicating uncertainty questionable. Our results indicate that new visualization formats can successfully reduce errors in interpretation.",

Most people now have access to the internet and many parents seek online parenting advice, so it is important to ensure that advice is both evidence-based and freely available. The 10-week online COPING parent programme presents information and activities based on core social learning theory principles. The programme provides information and video examples of parenting skills, uses quizzes to test knowledge and suggests home practice activities. This study was undertaken to obtain feedback on the usefulness and acceptability of the programme to inform its further development. Design and Methods The programme was created using the LifeGuide software and participants (n=20) were asked to complete one chapter of the programme each week and provide feedback. This feasibility study was undertaken to highlight any technical issues and suggest modifications prior to a more rigorous evaluation. Results Both participant feedback and programme usage data are reported. Thirteen feedback forms were returned and programme usage data was downloaded for all participants. Feedback suggested modifications that included adaptations to enable the programme to be accessed by tablet users, an option to look back over previously completed chapters, the inclusion of more video examples of positive parenting and text message prompting to address attrition challenges.",

Findings: Identified themes were the followings: depression is a factor in development and prognosis of CHD and affects the capacity to self-manage and adhere to treatment recommendations; culture mediates mental health/illness representations and treatment-seeking behaviors; screening and assessment of depression can be affected by cultural factors; and there is a need for culturally appropriate screening and therapeutic strategies. Discussion and Conclusions: As depression is a predictor and moderating variable in the genesis and progression of CHD, understanding how factors such as culture affect screening and management of the disease is important to inform the development of culturally and linguistically competent strategies that ensure accurate screening, detection, and treatment of depression in cardiac patients in clinical practice.",

In doing so, we note similarities to the intellectual tactics and strategies of the critical management community in terms of problematizing truth(s), broader aims to counter mainstream discourses of science and the various attempts to provide alternative perspectives on the world. In learning from these post-truth communities, we argue that the critical community should be wary of falling back onto a rational, logical and potentially elitist platform of Socratic critique and conversely should not refuse dialogue as in cynical critique.

A total of 88 deaf and hard-of-hearing students were interviewed retrospectively about their childhood and completed self-report questionnaires assessing psychological environment-directedness and present emotional and behavioral coping with deafness. It was partially supported that over-normative parental attitude negatively affected coping with deafness through the mediation of elevated environment-directedness.

      "title": "Sleep Research in the Era of AI",
      "abstract": "The field of sleep research is both broad and rapidly evolving. It spans from the diagnosis of sleep-related disorders to investigations of how sleep supports memory consolidation. The study of sleep includes a variety of approaches, starting with the sole focus on the visual interpretation of polysomnography characteristics and extending to the emergent use of advanced signal processing tools. Insights gained using artificial intelligence (AI) are rapidly reshaping the understanding of sleep-related disorders, enabling new approaches to basic neuroscientific studies. In this opinion article, we explore the emergent role of AI in sleep research, along two different axes: one clinical and one fundamental. In clinical research, we emphasize the use of AI for automated sleep scoring, diagnosing sleep-wake disorders and assessing measurements from wearable devices. In fundamental research, we highlight the use of AI to better understand the functional role of sleep in consolidating memories. While AI is likely to facilitate new advances in the field of sleep research, we also address challenges, such as bridging the gap between AI innovation and the clinic and mitigating inherent biases in AI models. AI has already contributed to major advances in the field of sleep research, and mindful deployment has the potential to enable further progress in the understanding of the neuropsychological benefits and functions of sleep.",

      "title": "A mixed-methods systematic review investigating the use of digital health interventions to provide palliative and end-of-life care for patients in low- and middle-income countries",
      "abstract": "Background: The need for palliative care is rising globally with 76% of those who are in need living in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Digital health interventions (DHIs) have been identified as a means of making palliative care more widely accessible. This review summarizes the range and characteristics of DHIs used to deliver palliative care in LMICs and sought to identify factors that influence their implementation and utilization. Objectives: This review aims to summarize the range and characteristics of DHIs used to deliver palliative care in LMICs and identify factors that influence their implementation and utilization. Design: Mixed-method systematic review incorporating both quantitative and qualitative data. Data sources and methods: All studies focusing on DHIs for patients who need palliative care (adults/children) and their caregivers (patient and caregiver centred) in LMICs and published in English were identified through a systematic search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO and CINAHL databases. Data synthesis and analysis were carried out following the convergent integrated approach based on the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) methodology for mixed-methods systematic reviews. Results: Fifteen studies were included (three qualitative, four mixed-methods and eight quantitative studies). Telemedicine/mHealth was the most reported DHI utilized in LMICs in delivering palliative care. Patients and caregivers benefited from using DHIs in many ways including increased access to care with reduced discomfort, travel time and risk of health care-associated infections. Health care providers also reported that using DHI such as telemedicine enables them to provide care in a more effective and efficient way. Four factors were identified as the main barriers to implementation: resource constraints; literacy, training and skills; governance, operational and communication issues and technical issues. Conclusion: DHIs, such as telemedicine, have the potential to enhance accessibility to palliative care in LMICs, particularly in rural areas. Comprehensive strategies for their use are required to address the identified barriers.",

      "abstract": "Individuals with serious mental disorders (SMD) may have a higher risk of vitamin D (VIT-D) deficiency. They also experience higher mortality because of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. Therefore, we have conducted a comprehensive review to examine the significance of VIT-D for public health and public mental health during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. This review had three specific aims, from a global perspective to (a) create a profile of VIT-D and review the epidemiology of VIT-D deficiency, (b) explore VIT-D deficiency as risk factor for SMD and COVID-19 infections and (c) examine the effectiveness of VIT-D supplementation for both conditions. We found that, in terms of SMD, the evidence from laboratory and observational studies points towards some association between VIT-D deficiency and depression or schizophrenia. Mendelian randomisation studies, however, suggest no, or reverse, causality. The evidence from intervention studies is conflicting. Concerning COVID-19 infection, on proof of principle, VIT-D could provide a plausible defence against the infection itself and against an adverse clinical course. But data from observational studies and the first preliminary intervention studies remain conflicting, with stronger evidence that VIT-D may mitigate the clinical course of COVID-19 infection rather than the risk of infection in the first place. From a public health and public mental health point of view, based on the currently limited knowledge, for individuals with SMD, the benefits of VIT-D optimisation through supplementation seem to outweigh the risks. VIT-D supplementation, however, should not substitute for vaccination or medical care for COVID-19 infection.",

      "abstract": "Aims: Previous research indicates that foreign-born populations experience more psychological distress than general populations. However, it remains unclear how prevalence varies between regions of origin. The role of socio-demographic and migration-related factors also needs to be further investigated. We aimed to (a) compare the prevalence of psychological distress in foreign-born and general Finnish populations, (b) investigate differences in prevalence between nine regions of origin and (c) examine which socio-demographic and migration-related factors are associated with distress among foreign-born populations. Methods: The study used data from the Survey on Well-Being among Foreign Born Population (FinMonik), a population-based survey ( n=6312) of foreign-born populations living in Finland collected between 2018 and 2019 by the Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare. Psychological distress was measured using the Mental Health Inventory-5 (MHI-5), with a cut-off point of 52. Logistic regression was used to adjust analyses by age and sex to determine the prevalence of psychological distress and the associated socio-demographic factors. Results: Psychological distress was more prevalent among those who were foreign born (17.4%) than among the general population (12.9%). Migrants from the Middle East and North Africa had the highest prevalence (29.7%) compared to other regions of origin. Unemployment or economic inactivity, international protection as a reason for migration and beginner-level language proficiency were the main factors increasing the odds for distress among foreign-born populations. Conclusions: Foreign-born populations experience more psychological distress than the general population, but prevalence varies between regions of origin. Future efforts should aim at a better understanding of the mental health risk factors and the development of targeted interventions for these subpopulations.",

      "abstract": "Unaccompanied refugee minors (URMs) are a group in an especially vulnerable situation with heightened psychological suffering due to both stressful life events and current daily stressors. Research has shown that certain coping strategies such as avoidance can be adaptive in the face of ongoing stress. We conceptualize social support as an essential coping resource that these strategies tap into. Since the interrelations between these factors are often not clear in the literature, this study strives to identify and link URMs\u2019 coping strategies, the respective coping resources and the various stressors they target, shortly after arrival in a high-income country. Seventy-nine URMs from various backgrounds were recruited in two first-phase reception centers in Belgium. In addition to self-report questionnaires to assess stressful life events and current daily stressors, we conducted semi-structured interviews, with cultural mediators if required. Thematic analysis was applied to the participants\u2019 accounts and resulted in the identification of four coping strategies: avoidance and distraction, continuity and coherence, selective reliance, and positive appraisal and acceptance. The relation between these coping strategies, the various coping resources used, and the specific stressors at which they aim are discussed. We conclude that avoidant coping and contact with the ethnic community, particularly the peer group, are fundamental strategies for successful coping. Practitioners need to support URMs in their coping efforts by providing and facilitating appropriate coping resources.",

Ten participants with cancer (nine females and one male, 40\u201389 years old) were given access to a bibliotherapy self-help ACT-based book and participated in post-intervention semi-structured interviews. Five themes were generated from reflexive thematic analysis: (1) The value of bibliotherapy (2) Timing is important (3) Resonating with cancer experiences (4) Tools of the book (5) ACT in action. The book was found to be acceptable (self-directed, accessible, understandable content, good responsiveness to exercises) and feasible (easy to use, ACT-consistent). Although not explicitly evaluated, participants\u2019 reports indicated defusion, present moment awareness, and consideration of values, as the ACT processes that contributed to adjustment, via helping them to regain control over their lives and become more present within the moment.

      "title": "Autistic young people adaptively use gaze to facilitate joint attention during multi-gestural dyadic interactions",
      "abstract": "Autistic people often experience difficulties navigating face-to-face social interactions. Historically, the empirical literature has characterised these difficulties as cognitive \u2018deficits\u2019 in social information processing. However, the empirical basis for such claims is lacking, with most studies failing to capture the complexity of social interactions, often distilling them into singular communicative modalities (e.g. gaze-based communication) that are rarely used in isolation in daily interactions. The current study examined how gaze was used in concert with communicative hand gestures during joint attention interactions. We employed an immersive virtual reality paradigm, where autistic ( n = 22) and non-autistic ( n = 22) young people completed a collaborative task with a non-autistic confederate. Integrated eye-, head- and hand-motion-tracking enabled dyads to communicate naturally with each other while offering objective measures of attention and behaviour. Autistic people in our sample were similarly, if not more, effective in responding to hand-cued joint attention bids compared with non-autistic people. Moreover, both autistic and non-autistic people demonstrated an ability to adaptively use gaze information to aid coordination. Our findings suggest that the intersecting fields of autism and social neuroscience research may have overstated the role of eye gaze during coordinated social interactions. Lay abstract Autistic people have been said to have \u2018problems\u2019 with joint attention, that is, looking where someone else is looking. Past studies of joint attention have used tasks that require autistic people to continuously look at and respond to eye-gaze cues. But joint attention can also be done using other social cues, like pointing. This study looked at whether autistic and non-autistic young people use another person\u2019s eye gaze during joint attention in a task that did not require them to look at their partner\u2019s face. In the task, each participant worked together with their partner to find a computer-generated object in virtual reality. Sometimes the participant had to help guide their partner to the object, and other times, they followed their partner\u2019s lead. Participants were told to point to guide one another but were not told to use eye gaze. Both autistic and non-autistic participants often looked at their partner\u2019s face during joint attention interactions and were faster to respond to their partner\u2019s hand-pointing when the partner also looked at the object before pointing. This shows that autistic people can and do use information from another person\u2019s eyes, even when they don\u2019t have to. It is possible that, by not forcing autistic young people to look at their partner\u2019s face and eyes, they were better able to gather information from their partner\u2019s face when needed, without being overwhelmed. This shows how important it is to design tasks that provide autistic people with opportunities to show what they can do.",

      "abstract": "Objective The aim of this systematic review was to investigate the efficacy of sensory discrimination training (SDT) on sensorimotor performance in individuals with a neurological condition affecting the central nervous system. Methods MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, AMED, CENTRAL, PsychINFO, Scopus, OT Seeker, PEDro, ETHOS, Web of Science and OpenGrey were systematically searched for appropriate randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Included studies were assessed for risk of bias, and the quality of the evidence was rated using the GRADE approach. The protocol was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42017055237). Results Six RCTs met the inclusion/exclusion criteria. All studies used manual tactile discrimination to retrain somatosensation. Somatosensory effect sizes (0.12\u20130.92) and motor function effect sizes (0.12\u201310.39) ranged from trivial to large with narrative analysis revealing some between-group difference in favour of the intervention group. However, the total sample size ( n = 220) was relatively small, and the quality of the included studies was low. Conclusions SDT may have potential to be an efficacious treatment option for improving sensorimotor performance in individuals with neurological disease. However, at present there is limited evidence on which to base any firm clinical recommendations.",

      "title": "The impact of healthcare systems on the clinical diagnosis and disease-modifying treatment usage in relapse-onset multiple sclerosis: a real-world perspective in five registries across Europe",
      "abstract": "Introduction: Prescribing guidance for disease-modifying treatment (DMT) in multiple sclerosis (MS) is centred on a clinical diagnosis of relapsing\u2013remitting MS (RRMS). DMT prescription guidelines and monitoring vary across countries. Standardising the approach to diagnosis of disease course, for example, assigning RRMS or secondary progressive MS (SPMS) diagnoses, allows examination of the impact of health system characteristics on the stated clinical diagnosis and treatment access. Methods: We analysed registry data from six cohorts in five countries (Czech Republic, Denmark, Germany, Sweden and United Kingdom) on patients with an initial diagnosis of RRMS. We standardised our approach utilising a pre-existing algorithm (DecisionTree, DT) to determine patient diagnoses of RRMS or secondary progressive MS (SPMS). We identified five global drivers of DMT prescribing: Provision, Availability, Funding, Monitoring and Audit, data were analysed against these concepts using meta-analysis and univariate meta-regression. Results: In 64,235 patients, we found variations in DMT use between countries, with higher usage in RRMS and lower usage in SPMS, with correspondingly lower usage in the UK compared to other registers. Factors such as female gender ( p = 0.041), increasing disability via Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score ( p = 0.004), and the presence of monitoring ( p = 0.029) in SPMS influenced the likelihood of receiving DMTs. Standardising the diagnosis revealed differences in reclassification rates from clinical RRMS to DT-SPMS, with Sweden having the lowest rate Sweden (Sweden 0.009, range: Denmark 0.103 \u2013 UK portal 0.311). Those with higher EDSS at index ( p &lt; 0.03) and female gender ( p &lt; 0.049) were more likely to be reclassified from RRMS to DT-SPMS. The study also explored the impact of diagnosis on DMT usage in clinical SPMS, finding that the prescribing environment and auditing practices affected access to treatment. Discussion: This highlights the importance of a healthcare system\u2019s approach to verifying the clinical label of MS course in facilitating appropriate prescribing, with some flexibility allowed in uncertain cases to ensure continued access to treatment.",

      "title": "Linguistic Analysis of Online Domestic Violence Testimonies in the Context of COVID-19",
      "abstract": "Worldwide, an increase in cases and severity of domestic violence (DV) has been reported as a result of social distancing measures implemented to decrease the spreading of the Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19). As one\u2019s language can provide insight in one\u2019s mental health, this pre-registered study analyzed word use in a DV online support group, aiming to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on DV victims in an ex post facto research design. Words reflecting social support and leisure activities were investigated as protective factors against linguistic indicators of depression in 5,856 posts from the r/domesticviolence subreddit and two neutral comparison subreddits (r/changemyview &amp; r/femalefashionadvice). In the DV support group, the average number of daily posts increased significantly by 22% from pre- to mid-pandemic. Confirmatory analysis was conducted following a registered pre-analysis plan. DV victims used significantly more linguistic indicators of depression than individuals in the comparison groups. This did not change with the onset of COVID-19. The use of negative emotion words was negatively related to the use of social support words (Spearman\u2019s rho correlation coefficient [rho] = \u22120.110) and words referring to leisure activities (rho = \u22120.137). Pre-occupation with COVID-19 was associated with the use of negative emotion words (rho = 0.148). We conclude that language of DV victims is characterized by indicators of depression and this characteristic is stable over time. Concerns with COVID-19 could contribute to negative emotions, whereas social support and leisure activities could function to some degree as protective factors. A potential weakness of this study is its cross-sectional design and the lack of experimental control. Future studies could make use of natural language processing and other advanced methods of linguistic analysis to learn about the mental health of DV victims.",

      "abstract": "Background: An increasing number of breast cancer patients undergo immediate or secondary breast reconstruction, but the ideal method in terms of patient satisfaction remains ambiguous. We compared the 3 most common breast reconstruction techniques to determine patient satisfaction and objective outcomes. Methods: Retrospective study of 184 patients with breast cancer who underwent a reconstructive procedure between 1993 and 2011 at our institution. Procedures evaluated were implant-based reconstruction (IBR) alone, latissimus dorsi (LD) flap reconstruction with/without implant, and deep inferior epigastric perforator (DIEP) free flap reconstruction. A retrospective patient satisfaction questionnaire was sent to all women. Twenty patients from each subgroup were matched to conduct a standardized objective assessment of the sensitivity of their reconstructed breast. A blinded photographic evaluation was also performed by 3 independent observers to assess the esthetic aspect and symmetry. Results: DIEP obtained significantly higher average scores regarding the esthetic outcome, immediate reconstruction impact, and overall score in the questionnaire evaluation. The IBR had the best results in the somatosensory evaluation, with DIEP scoring better than LD. DIEP received higher scores on average than LD for the criteria of size and symmetry in the esthetic evaluation. No statistically significant differences were observed between IBR and DIEP. Conclusions: Good results were reported overall for all breast reconstruction procedures, with more reserved scores for LD. The DIEP reconstruction appeared to be the most satisfactory and best experienced reconstruction method for patients, despite the complexity of the intervention. Clinicians should be encouraged to consider DIEP as the principal choice for breast reconstruction.",

Non-pharmacological interventions such as music therapy have been used to treat these symptoms in psychiatric hospitals and care homes but are not routinely used in general hospitals. We performed a systematic literature review to establish whether music therapy improves neuropsychiatric symptoms in adults with dementia and/or delirium in the general hospital setting. We searched CINAHL, Medline, PsycINFO in November 2015. Search terms included music therapy, dementia and delirium. Of 5054 titles reviewed we read 142 in full text of which none met inclusion criteria. We qualitatively reviewed six articles including 202 patients which could inform future research in music in general hospitals for people with dementia and/or delirium. Music delivery was feasible and had a positive effect on some aspects of neuropsychiatric symptoms in various settings, but the studies were generally small, at high risk of bias, and did not use recognised frameworks for evaluating complex interventions. We found no published evidence for the use of music therapy in the treatment of neuropsychiatric symptoms in patients with dementia and/or delirium in the general hospital setting.

      "abstract": "People with antisocial personality disorder (ASPD-nonPPD) are described as insensitive to others and as relentlessly pursuing their goals. A severe form of antisociality is observed in psychopathic personality disorder (ASPD-PPD). In the spectrum of emotional reactivity, people with ASPD-nonPPD present more emotional dysregulation, whereas people with ASPD-PPD exhibit a reduced or nonexistent emotional response. To personally engage people with ASPD-nonPPD and ASPD-PPD, we used emotionally charged autobiographical stimuli, specifically their self-defining memories (SDMs). As these participants exhibit high control over voluntary responses, we measured neurophysiological indicators (heart rate variability (HRV) and electrodermal activity (EDA)). In the resting task and the SDM task, people with ASPD-PPD had significantly higher HRV, suggesting higher emotion regulation abilities. Conversely, the EDA of people with ASPD-nonPPD and ASPD-PPD reflects less activation during the SDM task than when resting. We suggest that people with ASPD-PPD are more adaptive to stimuli that provide less emotional activation. Furthermore, the correlation analysis results suggested that the higher people with ASPD-PPD score on Factor 1 of the Psychopathy Checklist-Revised (PCL-R), the less emotional activation they exhibit. This low activation (EDA) associated with good emotion regulation abilities (HRV) is thought to be the signature of psychopathy.",

      "abstract": "Background: Airway clearance techniques (ACTs) are integral to cystic fibrosis (CF) management. However, there is no consensus as to which outcome measures (OMs) are best for assessing ACT efficacy. Objectives: To summarise OMs that have been assessed for their clinimetric properties (including validity, feasibility, reliability, and reproducibility) within the context of ACT research in CF. Design and Methods: A systematic review was conducted according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocols (PRISMA) standards. Any parallel or cross-over randomised controlled trial (RCT) investigating outcome measures for ACT in the CF population were eligible for inclusion. The search was performed in five medical databases, clinicaltrials.gov, and abstracts from international CF conferences. The authors planned to independently assess study quality and risk of bias using the COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of health status Measurement InstrumeNts (COSMIN) risk of bias checklist with external validity assessment based upon study details (participants and study intervention). Two review authors (GS and MJ) independently screened search results against inclusion criteria, and further data extraction were planned but not required. Results: No completed RCTs from the 187 studies identified met inclusion criteria for the primary or post hoc secondary objective. Two ongoing trials were identified. Discussion and conclusion: This empty systematic review highlights that high-quality RCTs are urgently needed to investigate and validate the clinimetric properties of OMs used to assess ACT efficacy. With the changing demographics of CF combined with the introduction of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulator therapies, an accurate assessment of the current benefit of ACT or the effect of ACT withdrawal is a high priority for clinical practice and future research; OMs which have been validated for this purpose are essential.

Methods In Phase I, the app functions needed to improve medication adherence were identified through a focus group with six patients with osteoporosis and a joint interview with two bone specialists. The app prototype was then developed (Phase II) and refined after its feasibility testing (Phase III) for 13\u201325 days by eight patients. Finally, the app underwent usability testing (Phase IV) for 6 months by nine other patients. The mHealth App Usability Questionnaire (MAUQ) was used to collect the assessment of the app by the 17 patients. Results The final version of the app provided information on osteoporosis, allowed patients to contact the bone specialist for an additional consultation, and generated a reminder for taking medications accompanied by feedback on adherence. The assessment of the app was positive but evaluations differed between the feasibility and usability testing, with the former displaying a significantly ( p \u2264 .05) better assessment across all MAUQ items. Conclusions In this study, we tested an app for improving adherence to medical therapies in patients with osteoporosis. The usability testing revealed a lower \u201cpatient-centered\u201d performance of the app as compared to that observed during the feasibility phase. Future developments of the study include increasing the testing cohort and adding a technical support during the usability testing.",

Healthcare resource utilization (HCRU; hospitalization, outpatient visits, and drug utilization) as well as productivity loss (sick leave and disability pension) before and after the CTEPH diagnosis is sparsely studied. By linking several Swedish national databases, this study estimated the societal costs in a national CTEPH cohort ( n = 369, diagnosed with CTEPH in 2008\u22122019) 5 years before and 5 years after diagnosis (index date) and compared to an age, sex, and geographically matched control group ( n = 1845, 1:5 match). HCRU and productivity loss were estimated per patient per year. Patients were stratified as operated with pulmonary endarterectomy (PEA group) or not operated (non\u2010PEA group). Direct and indirect societal costs were 2.1 times higher before, and 8.1 times higher after the index date for patients with CTEPH compared to the matched control groups. The higher costs were evident already several years preceding the index date. The main cost driver before the index date in both the PEA and the non\u2010PEA groups was productivity loss. The productivity loss remained high for both groups in the 5\u2010year period following the index date, but the main cost drivers were prescribed drugs and hospitalizations for patients that underwent PEA and prescribed drugs in the non\u2010PEA group. In conclusion, CTEPH was associated with large societal costs related to healthcare consumption and productivity loss, both before and after diagnosis.",

Using data from the Norwegian Mother, Father and Child Cohort study (MoBa), we perform exploratory ( N = 21,775) and confirmatory ( N = 21,674) factor analyses on items and compare our results with previously suggested factor structure models of the SCQ. Furthermore, we test for measurement invariance across sex and registry-ascertained autism diagnostic status ( N diagnosed = 636). A 5-factor model provided best fit to the data in both children with and without autism diagnoses, though with some qualitative differences in what the factors represent across these groups. This model performed largely consistently across boys and girls in the general population. Taken together, the SCQ\u2019s measurement properties must be carefully considered when it is used in population-based samples and measurement invariance testing of other autism screening tools used in similar contexts is warranted. Lay abstract Using questionnaires in research relies on the expectation that they measure the same things across different groups of individuals. If this is not true, then interpretations of results can be misleading when researchers compare responses across different groups of individuals or use in it a group that differs from that in which the questionnaire was developed. For the questionnaire we investigated, the Social Communication Questionnaire (SCQ), we found that parents of boys and girls responded to questionnaire items in largely the same way but that the SCQ measured traits and behaviors slightly differently depending on whether the children had autism. Based on these results, we concluded that researchers using this questionnaire should carefully consider these differences when deciding how to interpret findings. SCQ scores as a reflection of \u201cautism-associated traits\u201d in samples that are mostly or entirely made up of individuals without an autism diagnosis may be misleading and we encourage a more precise interpretation of scores as a broader indication of social-communicative and behavioral traits.",

To date, few studies have directly compared quantitative measurement methods in the early childhood field and the extent to which parent-reported and directly-measured behaviours agree is unclear. Existing studies are hampered by small sample sizes and the use of statistical techniques which quantify the magnitude of association between measures (e.g. correlations), but not agreement. Here we review the limitations of existing method comparisons and suggest how alternative statistical approaches such as the Bland-Altman Method and ordinary least products regression can be readily applied in the early childhood context. Understanding agreement (and disagreement) between measurement methods has potential to reduce research costs and improve data quality, with important implications for researchers, clinicians and policy-makers.",

      "abstract": "This article presents the findings of an intervention aimed at promoting positive emotions in music performance, as positive emotions are intrinsically valuable and can have associated benefits. The intervention sought to help participants conceive performance in more meaningful, self-transcendent terms. This study investigated whether the intervention helped performers to change their approach to performance; whether an increase in meaningfulness and self-transcendence led to more positive performance-related emotions; and whether an increase in positive emotions resulted in higher perceived quality of the performance. Comparison of self-report measures pre- and post-intervention indicated that after the intervention, participants approached performance in a more meaningful, self-transcendent manner. Specifically, they were more focused on the value of music, privilege of performing, and benefits for the audience. They also reported more rewarding performance experiences: they reported more joy, engagement, and self-confidence; more inspiration and connection with their audiences; and less anxiety. In addition, they reported being able to give better performances. None of these changes were found with a randomly assigned wait list control group. We conclude that an intervention designed to change performers\u2019 conceptions of the meaningfulness of performing can have beneficial impacts on the quality of that experience.",

      "abstract": "Introduction. The Adult Social Care Outcomes Toolkit (ASCOT) was developed in England to measure people\u2019s social care\u2013related quality of life (SCRQoL). Objectives. The aim of this article is to estimate preference weights for the Finnish ASCOT for service users (ASCOT). In addition, we tested for learning and fatigue effects in the choice experiment used to elicit the preference weights. Methods. The analysis data ( n = 1000 individuals) were obtained from an online survey sample of the Finnish adult general population using gender, age, and region as quotas. The questionnaire included a best-worst scaling (BWS) experiment using ASCOT. Each respondent sequentially selected four alternatives (best, worst; second-best, second-worst) for eight BWS tasks ( n = 32,000 choice observations). A scale multinomial logit model was used to estimate the preference parameters and to test for fatigue and learning. Results. The most and least preferred attribute-levels were \u201cI have as much control over my daily life as I want\u201d and \u201cI have no control over my daily life.\u201d The preference weights were not on a cardinal scale. The ordering effect was related to the second-best choices. Learning effect was in the last four tasks. Conclusions. This study has developed a set of preference weights for the ASCOT instrument in Finland, which can be used for investigating outcomes of social care interventions on adult populations. The learning effect calls for the development of study designs that reduce possible bias relating to preference uncertainty at the beginning of sequential BWS tasks. It also supports the adaptation of a modelling strategy in which the sequence of tasks is explicitly modelled as a scale factor.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a fatal disease that often occurs at an early age. In recent years, aggressive treatment with multiple drugs from the early\u2010stage diagnosis is expected to improve the prognosis. Indeed, a high rate of initial combination therapy and excellent treatment outcomes have been reported from specialized centers for PAH in Japan. However, information on PAH epidemiology, including non\u2010PAH specialized centers in Japan, is unclear. To address the above, we conducted a retrospective observational cohort study from April 2008 to September 2020 using real\u2010world evidence from a large\u2010scale administrative database (Medical Data Vision) to examine baseline characteristics, comorbidities, and treatment profiles of Japanese patients with PAH. Five hundred and eighteen patients with PAH (treatment\u2010naive PAH, age 67.2 \u00b1 15.9) were identified through our comprehensive approach which combined PAH disease codes, medications, and diagnostic procedures. Moreover, we showed that a larger proportion of patients received monotherapy in their initial treatment (66%) compared to those receiving combination therapy (34%). During the 1\u2010year follow\u2010up after PAH diagnosis, 13% of patients increased their PAH medications while other patients either decreased their PAH medications (6%) or discontinued PAH treatment (27%). The 3\u2010 and 5\u2010year event\u2010free survival rates of all\u2010cause death were 72% and 64%, respectively. This is the first large\u2010scale administrative database study that provides insights into real\u2010world PAH management in Japan. This study highlighted a different PAH clinical landscape which included a larger portion of the elderly population, higher initial monotherapy treatment, and lower survival rates than previous studies.",

We coupled these results with a qualitative analysis of 707 open-ended text responses to develop nine recommendations for organizations that accredit undergraduate psychology programs\u2014such as the British Psychological Society. We recommend that accreditation standards emphasize (1) data skills, (2) research design, (3) descriptive statistics, (4) critical analysis, (5) qualitative methods, and (6) both parameter estimation and significance testing; as well as (7) give precedence to foundational skills, (8) promote transferable skills, and (9) create space in curricula to enable these recommendations.

      "abstract": "Abstract Pulmonary hypertension is a common sequelae of left heart failure and may present as isolated postcapillary pulmonary hypertension (Ipc\u2010PH) or combined pre\u2010 and postcapillary pulmonary hypertension (Cpc\u2010PH). Clinical features associated with progression from Ipc\u2010PH to Cpc\u2010PH have not yet been described. We extracted clinical data from patients who underwent right heart catheterizations (RHC) on two separate occasions. Ipc\u2010PH was defined as mean pulmonary pressure &gt;20 mmHg, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure &gt;15 mmHg, and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) &lt; 3 WU. Progression to Cpc\u2010PH required an increase in PVR to \u22653 WU. We performed a retrospective cohort study with repeated assessments comparing subjects that progressed to Cpc\u2010PH to subjects that remained with Ipc\u2010PH. Of 153 patients with Ipc\u2010PH at baseline who underwent a repeat RHC after a median of 0.7 years (IQR 0.2, 2.1), 33% (50/153) had developed Cpc\u2010PH. In univariate analysis comparing the two groups at baseline, body mass index (BMI) and right atrial pressure were lower, while the prevalence of moderate or worse mitral regurgitation (MR) was higher among those who progressed. In age\u2010 and sex\u2010adjusted multivariable analysis, only BMI (OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.90\u20130.99, p = 0.017, C = 0.655) and moderate or worse MR (OR 3.00, 95% CI 1.37\u20136.60, p = 0.006, C = 0.654) predicted progression, but with poor discriminatory power. This study suggests that clinical features alone cannot distinguish patients at risk for development of Cpc\u2010PH and support the need for molecular and genetic studies to identify biomarkers of progression.",

      "abstract": "Movement variability has emerged as a critical research component in the field of neural motor control. This chapter explains why movement variability can be seen as such a rich resource for studying neural development and autism spectrum disorder. This cannot be done without a unifying framework for understanding the relationship between neural control, movement, and movement sensing. Thus, in the process of explaining why we should study movements, several analytical and empirical aspects of motor-sensed variability from self-generated actions are recast, as are their putative role in the development of motor-sensory-sensed maps of external stimuli present in social settings. This chapter offers a new lens for the research and treatment of neurodevelopmental disorders on a spectrum. This chapter thus proposes a general re-conceptualization of movement sensation and control. Through this a new framework for research and treatment of neurodevelopmental disorders in general we study ASD in particular.",

      "abstract": "Research on the bidirectional relationship between social connectedness and health/mental health in adolescents is scarce, with most studies on adults. Some of the existing studies exploited the availability of longitudinal data to provide evidence of the existence of a causal relationship, either from social connectedness to health or establish a bidirectional relationship. There are at least two weaknesses associated with earlier research to assess the size of the effects. As acknowledged in the literature, one relates to attributing causality to empirical findings, due to well-known but inadequately addressed endogeneity biases. The other relates to failure to account for potentially important covariates, sometimes due to data limitations, or because such variables are not frequently used in sociological research. Existing research predominantly finds that the strongest path is from social connectedness to health/mental health, with effect estimates modest in size. I followed a quasi-experimental strategy by modelling adolescent students' perceptions of social connectedness and mental health perceptions as potentially endogenous variables when estimating bidirectional effects. An instrumental variables (IV) modelling approach was followed, supplemented with a recently developed alternative approach to testing the exclusion restrictions of individual instruments. I exploited the rich information available in the PISA 2018 multi-country dataset, which allows for conditioning for a wide array of information on adolescent students' personal circumstances, self-reported personality-related attributes, relationships with parents; and school characteristics. I found that (1) accounting for endogeneity biases is important; and (2) as opposed to findings reported in the literature, the dominant effect is from mental health perceptions to social connectedness for both male and female participants. The policy relevance of the findings is that adolescent mental health should be the primary focus of interventions, i.e., identifying and treating mental health symptoms as a primary intervention and as a precursor to improving the social connectedness of adolescents.",

This scoping review aims to explore predictors for and consequences of a history of violence on women\u2019s pregnancy and childbirth in the Nordic countries, including women\u2019s experience of the impact of violence and the interventions used to detect, address consequences, and prevent further violence. The framework by Arksey and O\u2019Malley was followed, and English, Finnish, Icelandic, Norwegian, Danish, and Swedish literature was included. The population was women aged \u226518 residing in the Nordic countries during the perinatal period. Eight databases were searched: MEDLINE, CINAHL, PubMed, PsycINFO, Web of Science, ASSIA, Social Services-, and Sociological abstracts. There was no limitation of the search time frame. The initial screening resulted in 1,104 records, and after removing duplicates, 452 remained. Finally, 61 papers met the inclusion criteria. The results covering the past 32 years indicated that childbearing women with a history of violence are at greater risk of common complaints and hospitalization during pregnancy, fear of childbirth, Cesarean section, breastfeeding difficulties, and physical and mental health problems. While extensive research was found on the associations between a history of and current violence and outcomes related to pregnancy, there was a lack of intervention studies and studies from Finland.

To reduce this inequality, culturally adapted, multilingual, evidence-based practical assistance is needed. This paper details the Draw-Care study protocol including a randomised control trial (RCT) to test the effectiveness of a digital intervention comprising a multilingual website, virtual assistant, animated films, and information, on the lives of carers and people with dementia in Australia. Methods The Draw-Care intervention will be evaluated in a 12-week active waitlist parallel design RCT with 194 carers from Arabic, Cantonese, Greek, Hindi, Italian, Mandarin, Spanish, Tamil, and Vietnamese-speaking language groups. Our intervention was based on the World Health Organization's (WHO) iSupport Lite online carer support messages and was co-designed with carers, people with dementia, service providers, and clinicians. Culturally adapted multilingual digital resources were created in nine languages and English. Results In Phase I (2022), six co-design workshops with stakeholders and interviews with people with dementia informed the development of the intervention which will be trialled and evaluated in Phases II and III (2023 and 2024).

      "abstract": "Abstract Objective To characterize the prevalence of inadequate health literacy among otolaryngology patients and assess the association of individual patient factors with inadequate health literacy. Study Design Cross\u2010sectional study. Setting Tertiary academic medical center otolaryngology clinic. Methods Adult patients presenting to the clinic were recruited from March to June 2022. Participants completed a validated health literacy questionnaire in the waiting room. Data on age, sex, race, insurance, county of residence, and language were extracted from the electronic medical record, linked to the survey responses, and deidentified for analysis. Logistic regression analyses assessed the association between inadequate health literacy and patient factors. Results Of 374 participants, the mean age was 54.8 years (SD = 17.8) and most were white (79%) and native English speakers (95%). The median health literacy score was 14.5 (Q1\u2010Q3: 12.0\u201015.0) and 43 participants (12%) had inadequate health literacy. Bivariate analysis showed the odds of inadequate health literacy were 2.5 times greater for those with public insurance (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.24\u20105.20, P = .011), 3.5 times greater for males (95% CI: 1.75\u20106.92, P &lt; .001), and significantly different among race groups ( P = .003). When all factors were evaluated simultaneously with multivariable regression, only sex ( P &lt; .001) and race ( P = .005) remained significant predictors of inadequate health literacy. There were no significant associations between health literacy and age or rurality. Conclusion Inadequate health literacy was associated with sex and race, but not with age or rurality. 12% of patients had inadequate health literacy, which may perpetuate disparities in care and necessitate interventions to improve care delivery in otolaryngology.",

      "title": "Using the Social Return on Investment Framework to Evaluate Behavior Changes of Individuals Living With Learning Difficulties",
      "abstract": "A number of scholars have raised concerns that many social marketers fail to consider the cost of their programs and its related savings. One solution is to use the social return on investment (SROI) framework, which is rooted in the theory of change. To demonstrate its possibilities, a single case study, focusing on a small social enterprise based in the north of England, was used. They apply social marketing (SM) principles to influence positive behavior changes in people living with learning difficulties. The study was limited to their Teens-n-Twenties program, which was designed to support individuals between the ages of 14 and 25 become more independent. The results demonstrate that the program had an SROI valued somewhere between 2.36:1 and 3.88:1 (i.e., for every pound invested, a value of between \u00a32.36 and \u00a33.88 was delivered in social worth). This evaluation was used as evidence of the program\u2019s effectiveness in a continuing funding bid, and the organization was awarded just under \u00a3500 K from the United Kingdom\u2019s Big Lottery Fund. The study contributes to the knowledge and practice of SM by presenting a possible solution to the domain\u2019s concerns on how SM can be evaluated.",

      "title": "Evaluating the Extent of Participation of People Living With Dementia in Research",
      "abstract": "Most research about dementia consults with carers, community workers, nurses or other health professionals, but rarely with people living with dementia (PLWD). This paper investigates why this is the case and documents the extent to which dementia research includes those with lived experience. We searched for studies reported in academic articles focussing on dementia that described using participatory methods. Approximately half of the studies we found were excluded because the purpose of the research was commercial (developing apps or other products) and comprised only superficial product testing with PLWD rather than seeking any insight into their lived experience. Other studies were excluded because for various reasons, most significantly not meeting the definition of participatory methodology we adopted from Cornwall and Jewkes (1995). Ultimately only 27 academic articles were included in the analysis. In each of these studies the seven stages of research we identified (conception; design; participant recruitment; data collection; analysis; validation and knowledge translation) were evaluated for participatory methods. We found only one study which undertook participatory methodology in all stages which was the intended purpose of the research. We found that recruiting research participants, undertaking data analysis or validation with PLWD was seldom done and conceiving the study with PLWD was the rarest of all. In most studies we identified that participatory research was limited to only two or three research phases: data collection scored highest, then dissemination of data and then design. We found that participatory research with PLWD was not often considered possible and that rationales for the lack of consultation, when given, were largely ethical, or because of resource and time constraints. We found however that certain environments and approaches were more hospitable to PLWD involvement. This article describes exemplary examples of participatory research in different stages of the research processes, documents the strategies used to enhance participation and recommends increasing participatory methodology so as to better understand the perspectives and insights of PLWD making assessments and recommendations more effective.",

      "title": "Assessing the convergence of self-report and informant measures for adults with autism spectrum disorder",
      "abstract": "Self-report measures are widely used for research and clinical assessment of adults with autism spectrum disorder. However, there has been little research examining the convergence of self- and informant-report in this population. This study examined agreement between 40 pairs of adults with autism spectrum disorder and their caregivers on measures of symptom severity, daily living skills, quality of life, and unmet service needs. In addition, this study examined the predictive value of each reporter for objective independent living and employment outcomes. Caregiver and self-report scores were significantly positively correlated on all measures (all r\u2019s &gt;0.50). Results indicated that there were significant differences between reporter ratings of daily living skills, quality of life, and unmet service needs, but no significant differences between ratings of symptom severity. Combining caregiver-report and self-report measures provided significantly higher predictive value of objective outcomes than measures from a single reporter. These findings indicate that both informants provide valuable information and adults with autism spectrum disorder should be included in reporting on their own symptoms and experiences. Given that two reporters together were more predictive of objective outcomes; however, a multi-informant assessment may be the most comprehensive approach for evaluating current functioning and identifying service needs in this population. Lay Abstract Self-report measures are frequently used for research and clinical assessments of adults with autism spectrum disorder. However, there has been little research examining agreement between self-report and informant-report in this population. Valid self-report measures are essential for conducting research with and providing high quality clinical services for adults with autism spectrum disorder. This study collected measures from 40 pairs of adults with autism spectrum disorder and their caregivers on measures of symptom severity, daily living skills, quality of life, and unmet service needs. Caregiver and self-report responses were highly associated with one another on all measures, though there were significant gaps between scores on the measures of daily living skills and quality of life. It is also important to understand how each informant\u2019s responses relate to outcomes in the areas of employment and independent living. Using self-report and caregiver-report together better predicted outcomes for the adult with autism spectrum disorder than scores from either individual reporter alone. These findings show that there is unique and valuable information provided by both adults with autism spectrum disorder and their caregivers; a multi-informant approach is important for obtaining the most comprehensive picture of current functioning, identifying unmet service needs, and creating treatment plans. This research also highlights the importance of including and prioritizing self-report perspectives in shaping service planning.",

      "abstract": "Autistic individuals with intellectual disability are at greater risk of experiencing anxiety than their non-autistic peers without intellectual disability. Anxiety in this group may present as behaviour that challenges, often leading families to reach out to healthcare or support services. However, many families experience difficulties accessing services and, due to the lack of research into evidence-based anxiety interventions for people with intellectual disability, may not receive individualised support once in a service. This study explored caregivers\u2019 experiences of accessing services for autistic individuals with intellectual disability, and their considerations when developing new interventions for this population. Interviews and focus groups were completed with 16 caregivers of autistic people with intellectual disability. Reflexive thematic analysis was used to develop five themes about service access experiences, and three themes about caregiver considerations for anxiety interventions. Caregivers reported that their experiences of accessing services did not meet their expectations, and considerations for future anxiety interventions were often reflective of this. Interventions being flexible to family circumstances to aid accessibility, the embedding of peer support in services, and skills that can be generalised across the lifespan could be applied when aiming to improve outcomes and develop interventions for this under-served population. Lay Abstract Many autistic individuals with intellectual disability experience anxiety, and for those who use few or no words, anxiety may present as behaviour that challenges, such as self-injury and avoiding anxiety-provoking situations. Families report difficulty accessing support from services for autistic individuals experiencing anxiety. Moreover, once receiving support, effective interventions for autistic people with intellectual disability are limited. We completed individual and group discussions with 16 caregivers of autistic people with intellectual disability, to (a) explore their experiences of accessing services for anxiety and/or behaviour that challenges for their child; and (b) understand what matters to caregivers when developing interventions that have been designed for them and the autistic individual with intellectual disability that they support. Caregivers reported that services, in their experience, did not deliver the support that they expected, and that they often needed to \u2018fight\u2019 for support. Caregivers considered services and families working together, the inclusion of peer support, and families being offered interventions that are flexible to individual circumstances to be important. These considerations are valuable for clinicians and researchers developing interventions and aiming to improve outcomes for autistic people with intellectual disability and their families.",

Method: Literature searches were conducted in PsycInfo, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science, resulting in 1,739 articles. After screening, 41 articles were included. Results were summarized using a narrative approach. Results: The prevalence of ADHD in adolescents and adults with SAD ranged from 1.1% to 72.3%, while the prevalence of SAD in those with ADHD ranged from 0.04% to 49.5%. Studies indicate that individuals with both SAD and ADHD exhibit greater impairments. All studies were judged to be of weak quality, except for two studies which were rated moderate quality. Discussion: Individuals with SAD should be screened for ADHD and vice versa, to identify this common comorbidity earlier. Further research is needed to better understand the prevalence of comorbid ADHD and SAD in adolescents.",

      "abstract": "Background Fetal ultrasound has limitations, especially if the patient is obese or in cases with oligohydramnios. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can then be used as a complement, but only few studies have focused on examinations in the second trimester. Purpose To validate MRI as a complement to diagnose fetal anomalies in the second trimester. Material and Methods This retrospective study retrieved data from January 2008 to July 2012 from the Fetal Medicine Unit and Department of Radiology at Uppsala University Hospital. Ultrasound and MRI findings were reviewed in 121 fetuses in relation to the final diagnosis, including postpartum follow-up and autopsy results. Results Of the 121 fetuses, 51 (42%) had a CNS anomaly and 70 (58%) a non-CNS anomaly diagnosed or suspected. MRI provided additional information in 21% of all cases without changing the management and revealed information that changed the management of the pregnancy in 13%. When a CNS anomaly was detected or suspected, the MRI provided additional information in 22% and changed the management in 10%. The corresponding figures for non-CNS cases were 21% and 16%, respectively. The proportion of cases with additional information that changed the management was especially high in patients with a BMI &gt;30 kg/m 2 (25%) and in patients with oligohydramnios (38%). In five cases in category III, false-positive ultrasound findings were identified. Conclusions MRI in the second trimester complements ultrasound and improves diagnosis of fetal CNS- and non-CNS anomalies especially when oligohydramnios or maternal obesity is present.",

Study Design Cross\u2010sectional. Setting Online. Methods An administered survey with questions asking about demographics, cancer history, treatment choices, and feelings about OSGs was posted on the 5 largest HNC OSGs on Facebook. Results A total of 97 participants completed the survey. Mean age was 57.8 years old (standard deviation = 10.7 years). Most participants were female (50.5%) and Caucasian (92.8%). This cohort was well educated with 65.5% holding at least a college degree. Annual income was high with 41.8% reporting annual income of $100,000 or greater. The most common treatment modality was radiation (88.7%). The most common surgery was neck dissection (46.4%). Most participants preferred OSGs (70.8%) over other support group types. OSGs were heavily utilized with our cohort reporting using the OSG at least several times a week (80.0%). The top reasons for joining the OSG were sharing one's experience of HNC (76.3%) and gaining support from others with HNC (85.6%). OSGs were ranked as the #3 source of medical information for HNC behind otolaryngologists and oncologists. Membership in a HNC OSG had a minimal impact on decision\u2010making. Conclusion HNC OSGs appear to provide a beneficial community for HNC patients. Otolaryngologists should consider incorporating HNC OSG as a possible supplemental resource for their HNC patients.",

      "abstract": "Young people with special educational needs (SEN), such as intellectual disability and/or autism, are particularly vulnerable to child sexual exploitation and abuse (CSEA). This mixed-methods systematic literature review consolidates findings in respect to how young people with SEN are currently being taught about CSEA in the UK, incorporating empirical and practice-based findings to counteract publication bias. Key databases were searched, and relevant organizations were contacted regarding studies published between 2015 and 2022 (inclusive). Thirteen articles met the inclusion criteria. Of these, 10 adopted a qualitative methodology, and three a mixed-methods approach. The thematic synthesis of the qualitative studies identified the following themes: (a) beliefs and stereotypes about CSEA, vulnerability. and risk have led to young people with SEN being misinformed and misunderstood, and (b) anxiety about the topic of sex and abuse creates polarized views regarding CSEA education in adult guardians of young people with SEN. Themes are discussed in the context of societal biases in respect to vulnerability and risk, and these biases are considered to have a negative effect on how young people with SEN are supported. The findings of this review encourage providers of CSEA awareness education to be mindful of not endorsing harmful stereotypes, and to involve parent\u2013carers as much as possible. This review additionally encourages services and organizations to increase focus on practitioner reflexivity and regular training to counteract potential biases in respect to gender, vulnerability, and risk.",

We aim to analyze differences in dysphagia diagnoses and swallowing\u2010related quality\u2010of\u2010life among these age subgroups. Study Design Retrospective chart review. Setting Tertiary care laryngology clinic. Subjects and Methods We identified chief complaint, diagnosis, and self\u2010reported swallowing handicap (Eating Assessment Tool [EAT\u201010] score) of all new patients aged \u226565 years presenting to the Johns Hopkins Voice Center between April 2015 and March 2017. Dysphagia diagnoses were classified by physiologic etiology and anatomic source. Diagnostic categories and EAT\u201010 score were evaluated as functions of patient age and sex. Results Of 839 new patients aged \u226565 years, 109 (13.0%) reported a chief complaint of dysphagia and were included in this study. The most common dysphagia etiologies were neurologic and esophageal. Most common diagnoses were diverticula (15.6%), reflux (13.8%), and radiation induced (8.3%). Diverticula, cricopharyngeal hypertonicity, and radiation\u2010induced changes were associated with higher EAT\u201010 score ( P &lt;. 001). Significant differences by sex were found in anatomic source of dysphagia, as men and women were more likely to present with oropharyngeal and esophageal disease, respectively ( P =. 023). Dysphagia etiology and EAT\u201010 score were similar across age subgroups. Conclusion Important differences among dysphagia diagnosis and EAT\u201010 score exist among patients aged \u226565 years. Knowledge of these differences may inform diagnostic workup, management, and further investigations in geriatric otolaryngology.",

Islet transplantation is a surgical procedure that has demonstrated the ability to normalize blood sugar levels for up to a few years, but the need for chronic immunosuppression relegates it to a last resort that is often only used sparingly and in seriously ill patients. Islet microencapsulation is a biomedical innovation designed to protect islets from the immune system by coating them with a biocompatible polymer, and this new technology has demonstrated various degrees of success in small- and large-animal studies. This success is significantly impacted by microcapsule morphology and encapsulation efficiency. Since hundreds of thousands of microcapsules are generated during the process, characterization of encapsulated islets without the help of some degree of automation would be difficult, time-consuming, and error prone due to inherent observer bias. We have developed an image analysis algorithm that can analyze hundreds of microencapsulated islets and characterize their size, shape, circularity, and distortion with minimal observer bias. This algorithm can be easily adapted to similar nano- or microencapsulation technologies to implement stricter quality control and improve biomaterial device design and success.",

      "title": "Investigating Interdisciplinarity and Transdisciplinarity: How Meta-Ethnography Contributes to the Study of Collaborative Research Practices",
      "abstract": "Interdisciplinarity and transdisciplinarity are collaborative research modes that help advance science dealing with grand societal challenges. However, many factors still act as obstacles to high-impact research, showing disconnections between practices and policies. We can reasonably question whether we are still incapable of applying the correct methods to grasp interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary heterogeneity. This article aims to deepen the discussion of the methodological options for critically studying interdisciplinarity and transdisciplinarity. By applying meta-ethnography to the inter- and transdisciplinary academic literature, the paper inquires about the suitability of the method to study bodies of knowledge on interdisciplinarity and transdisciplinarity. Meta-ethnography is a seven-phase literature review type of meta-synthesis aimed at creating new understandings and theories from a body of work. Applying an autoethnographic approach, I show how meta-ethnography allows for the reconceptualisation of a disparate and dispersed body of literature, advancing current discussions on inter- and transdisciplinarity and their roles in science and policy. The approach outlined in the article is innovative because it contributes to two related realms: (i) it helps advance the field of inter- and transdisciplinary research and policy because it refines the methods available to study these multidimensional practices, and (ii) it offers an example of the further adaptability of meta-ethnography to new topics, such as the investigation of collaborative settings. I analyse six challenges in light of the scientific literature and conclude by focusing on the value meta-ethnography has for studying interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary research and propose two methodological innovations.",

      "abstract": "Aims: Adolescents living in vulnerable socioeconomic conditions are confronted with tobacco-related health disparities. As school-based interventions appear to be less effective among these youngsters, other approaches are necessary. One promising avenue is youth social work settings that offer sport and recreational activities (SR-settings). SR-settings have been examined as a levering context for health promotion, but evidence regarding smoking prevention is currently lacking. Methods: This study describes the protocol of a non-randomised cluster controlled trial evaluating a smoking prevention intervention for adolescents. At least 24 SR-settings are needed for the intervention and control group. A mixed-method design will be used. Quantitative measures will be used to assess effectiveness, involving validated questionnaires on smoking initiation behaviour and influencing factors (i.e. attitude, self-efficacy, social influence and risk perception). In addition, feasibility will be assessed with regard to intervention fidelity, dose and reach. Data will be collected at baseline, three and nine months following the intervention. To gain deeper understanding on the impact and underlying processes of the intervention, we will conduct qualitative interviews with users (adolescents) and implementers (youth workers within the SR-settings) of the intervention. Conclusions: Conducting this trial will offer novel insights into the effectiveness of a smoking prevention intervention designed for adolescents living in vulnerable socioeconomic conditions. A mixed-method design will enable to measure impact, implementation and underlying processes of the intervention. Overall, this design will enhance our understanding on the suitability of SR-settings as contexts for smoking prevention initiatives targeting hard-to-reach youth.

We aim to describe sample selection, recruitment methods and reasons for non-participation in The PRedictors and Outcomes of incident FRACtures (PROFRAC) study. Design and Methods Barwon Statistical Division residents aged 20+ years, with a radiologically-confirmed fracture between June 1 st 2012 and May 31 st 2013, were eligible. Individuals identified as fracture cases were invited by mail to complete a questionnaire. Reasons for non-participation were documented. Logistic regression techniques were used to determine odds ratios for participation and non-participation reasons. Results A total of 1,458 of 2,155 (67.7%) adults with fracture (48.7% men) participated. Individuals were excluded due to inability to give informed consent, death, no knowledge of fracture, or inability to be contacted. The odds of participation decreased with age (OR 0.99, 95%CI 0.99-0.99, P=0.011) and increased among specific fracture groups [clavicle/scapula (OR 2.50, 1.30-4.68, P=0.006), forearm/humerus (OR 2.00, 1.22-3.27, P=0.006), wrist (OR 2.08, 1.31-3.32, P=0.002), hip (OR 2.12, 1.20-3.75, P=0.009), ankle (OR 1.85, 1.20-2.87, P=0.001), compared to face/skull fractures]. The odds of reporting disinterest, time constraints or personal reasons as the reason for non-participation decreased with age, whereas the odds of reporting frailty, language-related issues or illness as the reason for non-participation increased with of age [disinterest (OR 0.98, 0.97-0.98, P&lt;0.001), time constraints (OR 0.97, 0.96-0.98, P&lt;0.001), personal reasons (OR 0.98, 0.97-0.99, P=0.007), frailty (OR 1.12, 1.09-1.15, P&lt;0.001), language-related issues (OR 1.02, 1.01-1.04, P&lt;0.001), illness (OR 1.03, 1.02-1.05, P&lt;0.001)].

      "abstract": "Evidence suggests that the incidence of research misconduct is not in decline despite efforts to improve awareness, education and governance mechanisms. Two responses to this problem are favoured: first, the promotion of an agent-centred ethics approach to enhance researchers\u2019 personal responsibility and accountability, and second, a change in research culture to relieve perceived pressures to engage in misconduct. This article discusses the challenges for both responses and explains how normative coherence through values alignment might assist. We argue that research integrity and research ethics convey mixed messages, which are likely to contribute to a form of normative confusion. For the successful adoption of an agent-centred approach, normative coherence is needed between the two. To facilitate normative coherence, we propose that research ethics and research integrity be underpinned by a shared set of moral values that can be enacted via codes and guidelines and imbue research environments. Furthermore, to facilitate culture change, the same normative coherence is necessary at all levels of an institution. Only via values alignment between institutional aims, management, institutional practices and researchers can an ethical culture become truly embedded in research institutions.",

      "abstract": "The promotion of health literacy was a key public health strategy during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the role of social networks and relationships for support with health literacy-related tasks in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic is scarcely understood. Moving beyond traditional notions of health literacy, which focus on individual skills and knowledge, this study uses the concept of distributed health literacy to explore how individuals make meaning of and respond to health literacy and make their literacy skills available to others through their relational and socially situated and lived experiences of the COVID-19 pandemic. Drawing on 89 semi-structured interviews conducted in three European countries (Italy, Portugal, and Switzerland) between October and December 2021, we found narratives of stabilization, hybridization, and disruption that show how health literacy concerning COVID-19 is a complex social construct intertwined with emotional, cognitive, and behavioral responses distributed among individuals, communities, and institutions within socioeconomic and political contexts that affect their existence. This paper opens new empirical directions to understand the critical engagement of individuals and communities toward health information aimed at making sense of a complex and prolonged situation of uncertainty in a pandemic.",

      "abstract": "Perceived discrimination has been found to be a common acculturative stressor among migrants negatively affecting their psychological acculturation process. Yet, a comprehensive review that focuses on how perceived discrimination is conceptualized and operationalized in the acculturation context is still missing. Furthermore, it is still unclear whether subtle and blatant forms of discrimination have been considered and compared in their effects in the acculturation literature, albeit some research suggests that the distinction between these two forms of discrimination is relevant and should be considered. Following the guidelines of the Joanna Briggs Institute, the present scoping review aimed to provide a systematic map of how perceived discrimination has been studied in the literature on first-generation adult immigrants\u2019 psychological acculturation. A comprehensive search was executed in three databases (EBSCO, Scopus, and Web of Science), and 2,872 relevant sources were identified. A total of 143 studies were included after screening abstracts and full texts. A systematic coding scheme was then applied to all included articles. Results showed that 80% of the studies were cross-sectional and/or considered discrimination as a predictor of psychological outcomes, while other variables, for example, acculturation orientations and identity constructs, have been much less studied. Perceived discrimination was measured with over 50 different scales, yet only 10% of the studies made a clear conceptual difference between subtle and blatant discrimination. Moreover, the operationalization of these two forms of discrimination was often ambiguous. The present review identifies important knowledge gaps in the acculturation literature and draws recommendations for future research.",

      "abstract": "Aim: This study investigates the effects of degree of multilingualism on cognitive functions in adulthood, with focus on episodic memory recall and including measures of verbal fluency as well as global cognition. Design: We studied a large population-based cohort cross-sectionally, and we also assessed changes over time through longitudinal measurements on four time-points over a 15 year period. Participants were drawn from the Betula prospective cohort study in Ume\u00e5, Sweden. The participants included in this study at baseline ( n = 894, mean age = 51.44, 59.4% females) were divided according to number of languages into bilinguals ( n = 395), trilinguals ( n = 284), quadrilinguals ( n = 169), and pentalinguals ( n = 46). Data and analysis: We analysed performance on tasks of episodic memory recall, verbal fluency (letter and category) and global cognition (Minimental State Examination, MMSE) both cross-sectionally and longitudinally. The control background variables were baseline age, gender, years of education, general fluid ability Gf (Wechsler Block Design Test), and socioeconomic status. We employed a linear mixed modelling approach with entropy balancing weights to assess effects of degree of multilingualism on cognitive functions. Findings and conclusions: Using bilinguals as the reference group, our results indicated that all the other multilingual groups exhibited superior performance on episodic memory recall than bilinguals at baseline. The rate of change over time did not differ for trilinguals and pentalinguals compared to bilinguals. While quadrilinguals declined more over time than bilinguals, they still scored significantly higher than bilinguals at the last test wave. For letter fluency, similarly, all language groups scored higher than bilinguals at baseline, and none of the groups differed from bilinguals in rate of change over time. With regard to category fluency, quadrilinguals scored higher than bilinguals at baseline, but trilinguals and pentalinguals did not differ from bilinguals and none of the groups differed in change over time compared to bilinguals. Finally, for global cognition (MMSE), trilinguals and quadrilinguals scored significantly higher than bilinguals at baseline with no differences in change over time for any of the groups relative to bilinguals. Our study contributes to the understanding of multilingual cognition and sheds light into an under-researched cognitive domain known to decline in normal ageing, namely episodic memory recall. Significance: Our study emphasizes the importance of researching less explored aspects of multilingualism on cognition, in particular on episodic memory recall, to aid our understanding of factors that could potentially aid cognitive decline in later adulthood.",

Interdisciplinarity, team science, and transdisciplinarity frame academic and problem-focused collaborations narrowly, overemphasizing epistemology, downplaying extra-disciplinary divides and nonacademic collaborators, and either ignoring or psychologizing individual-level phenomena. We first paint a picture of the tensions and divides that exist in pluralistic collaborations, in three dimensions\u2014epistemic, cultural, and normative\u2014using a series of literature reviews to simultaneously map and extend these dimensions. We then introduce and explore a fourth dimension\u2014academic work styles. Individual level considerations of collaboration in the literature generally rely on psychological types. We explore what a more sociologically oriented approach to individual dynamics within collaborations would look like by identifying and exploring four general academic work styles: isolationist, imperialist, pragmatist, and pluralist. We conclude by emphasizing and reflecting on pluralistic collaboration. Pluralism exists along a range of dimensions, and pluralizing or homogenizing different dimensions (pluralizing pluralism) can produce diverse effects on the outcome of interdisciplinary collaboration. While we thus advocate for pluralism along a greater range of dimensions when addressing complex problems, we suggest that over-pluralization can be a problem.",

Unfortunately, recent data from a content analysis via PsycInfo and a cross-cultural survey study ( N=273) showed that well-trained psychologists around the world and psychology students in the United States and in China are unfamiliar with Wundt and Freud's totemic contributions to psychology today.

A recent scoping review explored VR applications to assist pregnant women and found that VR was a useful method to be used for a range of different purposes in both pregnancy and labour. However, no such review exists for the period after birth. Method We aimed to search for studies that used VR to support parents during birth and in the first year postpartum (Population) in different settings (Context), and finally provided data on the characteristics, reported effectiveness and experience of VR interventions (Concept). Two hundred and fifty-one studies were identified, of which ten were eligible. Two authors independently extracted data including study design, participants and results. Results Findings indicate that VR has been used effectively in this context to alleviate depression anxiety, and multiple domains of pain and to improve childbirth satisfaction. The majority of the studies explored the use of VR technology on outcomes such as pain and anxiety during labour and birth. The studies included used a broad range of VR hardware and software. All of the studies reported positive experiences of using VR. Conclusions Across these studies, VR was found to be effective in terms of both physiological and psychological outcomes. There are many unexplored maternal and infant focused applications of VR which warrant further investigation as emerging evidence indicates this is becoming an increasingly accessible method to improve maternal and infant health outcomes from pregnancy through to parenthood.",

      "title": "Unpaid carers of people with dementia and information communication technology: Use, impact and ideas for the future",
      "abstract": "Objectives Several 100,000s of people living with dementia in the UK are cared for at home by a spouse or relative. Few studies have considered the ICT needs and experiences of unpaid carers. This study explores the types of ICT unpaid carers use, the ways they use ICT, the impact of ICT-use, and their ideas for how ICT could be more supportive of their role as a carer. Methods Six focus groups with 32 unpaid carers of people living with dementia discussed their experiences of \u2013 and barriers to \u2013 using ICT. Transcripts were analysed thematically according to three types of ICT (mainstream, accessible and formal) and five functions (supporting domestic tasks, care management, monitoring, communication and information and education). Results Participants predominantly used mainstream ICT devices such as laptops and smartphones and internet-enabled applications including videoconferencing and social media platforms to support their daily activities and assist them in their caring role. A few participants discussed using accessible devices such as memory clocks and formal telecare and care-phone services for care management and monitoring functions. Participants\u2019 ideas for improvements centred on personalised communication applications that facilitate remote interactions and promote persons living with dementia\u2019s independence. Others expressed concerns about the growing need to use ICT to access formal care services and the inadequacy of the ICT infrastructure in some care homes. Conclusions Unpaid carers mostly turn to readily available mainstream ICT to support their personal and care activities. Further research is required to understand the social impact of the increasing reliance of ICT across health, social and residential care service sectors. Improved cooperation between unpaid carers, technology developers and care services providers could align ICT development to the needs and experiences of families living with dementia and assist unpaid carers with identifying ICTs that optimally support their personal circumstances.",

      "abstract": "People living alone are often depicted as prone to social isolation and poor well-being. Since previous research largely focused on comparisons between the living arrangements of older adults, evidence on differences within middle-aged adults living alone remains sparse. The present study used a person-centered approach to allow for a comprehensive understanding of the heterogeneity of living alone in midlife. Middle-aged adults ( N = 389; aged 35\u201360 years) reported on their personal networks, personality, and well-being and completed diaries on daily network interactions. Using latent class analysis, we constructed a network typology and examined differences in social motives, well-being, daily interaction quantity, and daily relationship quality. We found four structural network types: Individuals with diverse networks (highest in size, contact, proximity, and heterogeneity) felt less lonely than individuals with restricted (lowest in size, contact, proximity, and heterogeneity) or loose-knit networks (low in contact). Individuals with loose-knit networks reported poorer well-being than those in diverse or partner-focused networks (all partnered). We found little support for differences in social motives. All network types differed in daily interaction quantity but did not differ in daily relationship quality. The study highlights the heterogeneity of personal networks in middle-aged adults living alone. Possible implications for the social embeddedness and psychological adaptation of people living alone in midlife are discussed.",

      "title": "Modified T<sup>2</sup> Statistics for Improved Detection of Aided Cortical Auditory Evoked Potentials in Hearing-Impaired Infants",
      "abstract": "The cortical auditory evoked potential (CAEP) is a change in neural activity in response to sound, and is of interest for audiological assessment of infants, especially those who use hearing aids. Within this population, CAEP waveforms are known to vary substantially across individuals, which makes detecting the CAEP through visual inspection a challenging task. It also means that some of the best automated CAEP detection methods used in adults are probably not suitable for this population. This study therefore evaluates and optimizes the performance of new and existing methods for aided (i.e., the stimuli are presented through subjects\u2019 hearing aid(s)) CAEP detection in infants with hearing loss. Methods include the conventional Hotellings T 2 test, various modified q-sample statistics, and two novel variants of T 2 statistics, which were designed to exploit the correlation structure underlying the data. Various additional methods from the literature were also evaluated, including the previously best-performing methods for adult CAEP detection. Data for the assessment consisted of aided CAEPs recorded from 59 infant hearing aid users with mild to profound bilateral hearing loss, and simulated signals. The highest test sensitivities were observed for the modified T 2 statistics, followed by the modified q-sample statistics, and lastly by the conventional Hotelling's T 2 test, which showed low detection rates for ensemble sizes &lt;80 epochs. The high test sensitivities at small ensemble sizes observed for the modified T 2 and q-sample statistics are especially relevant for infant testing, as the time available for data collection tends to be limited in this population.",

The research presented in this paper is an example of a qualitative, inclusive approach to studying the felt and lived experience of 33 same-sex parents. It draws on a wider study on 80 informal caregivers, who were different in terms of gender, type of care, marital status, and sexual orientation. Its aim was to offer a more inclusive interpretation and a more reliable discourse on family care and parenthood. The research objective was to gain insights into the emotional mechanisms through which the dynamics of inclusion or exclusion are interactionally and situationally constructed and/or challenged while doing care. In this paper I illustrate the mix of creative, qualitative methods I employed to explore the experiences of a group of same-sex parents living in Philadelphia (USA).",

      "abstract": "Purpose The ability to develop and evaluate approaches to the management of advanced cancer in sub-Saharan Africa is limited by the lack of local, reliable and valid data to ensure that practice is evidence-based, replicable and reflects the needs of the population served. Methods A secondary qualitative analysis of in-depth interviews with 59 health professionals delivering palliative cancer care in Nigeria, Uganda and Zimbabwe were conducted to determine the use and needs for data and information for patient care and service delivery. Framework analysis was used, informed by a conceptual model for data use in low and middle-income countries. Results Three meta-themes include: (1) Current practice in data gathering and use; (2) Gaps for capturing, storing information and supporting communication, and; (3) Needs and opportunities for data use. Deficits in current data access and use were identified, alongside targets for improving the quality, accessibility and utility of data to inform the development of palliative cancer care. Conclusions The availability and use of relevant and reliable data relating to the current provision of palliative cancer care are requisite for the contextually appropriate and effective development of health services. The requirements and constraints articulated by participants can guide future development and optimisation of digital health approaches for palliative cancer care in the participating countries, with relevance to the wider sub-Saharan Africa region.",

      "abstract": "The digital divide between the Global South and North has been a major concern for researchers from various fields in the past two decades. This divide has led to an increased focus on research related to information and communication technology for development (ICT4D) and other relevant disciplines. Given the prevalence of dominant paradigms that often lead to aggregated and context-free observations, this paper emphasizes the role of context in ICT4D while advocating for more nuanced, context-specific approaches in research and policy formulation. Through a systematic literature review, it proposes a conceptual framework that captures the psycho-social and the structural dimensions of context in ICT4D as well as their impact on success of related projects. The paper highlights the need for tailored theories addressing often overlooked elements such as language, ethnicity, religion, government change, political instability, and legal frameworks in the context of ICT4D. The proposed framework offers a roadmap for researchers to navigate the complex context of ICT4D, especially in the realm of emerging technologies.",

      "abstract": "The complexity of societal risks such as pandemics, artificial intelligence, and climate change may lead laypeople to rely on experts and authorities when evaluating these threats. While Siegrist and Cvetkovich showed that competence-based trust in authorities correlates with perceived societal risks and benefits only when people feel unknowledgeable, recent research has yielded mixed support for this foundational work. To address this discrepancy, we conducted a direct-replication study (preregistered; 1,070 participants, 33 risks, 35,310 observations). The results contradict the original findings. However, additional non-preregistered analyses indicate an alternative perspective aligning with compensatory control theory and the description-experience framework: experiences with insufficient personal control over a threat may amplify individuals\u2019 dependency on powerful others for risk mitigation. These findings highlight the need to reevaluate how trust shapes risk perceptions. Recent societal and technological shifts might have heightened the desire for control compared to subjective knowledge in why people resort to trust.",

      "abstract": "Introduction Educational health promotion interventions for people with early-stage dementia have shown promising results, including empowering the person with dementia to live well and cope with their condition. Objective(s) The aim of this study was to explore how group interactions, course structure, and facilitation by healthcare professionals in a 12-week educational health promotion course promote coping, healthy behaviors, and empowerment in people with early-stage dementia. Method A focused ethnographic approach was employed, collecting data through moderate participant observations of people with early-stage dementia who attended the health promotion course and field conversations with the facilitators. Additionally, before and after the participants had completed the course, the participants and their care partners were interviewed individually. Results The findings showed that group discussions provided an opportunity for the facilitators to identify knowledge gaps, correct misinterpretations of symptoms, and tailor the information to the participants\u2019 specific needs, thereby promoting healthy behaviors and empowering the participants. The consistent and structured format of the course appeared to reduce stress and promote learning. Learning about dementia first-hand, reminiscing, using humor, receiving support from others facing similar challenges, and receiving support and validation from facilitators all contributed to participants coping with their condition, processing negative emotions, and reducing internalized stigma. Conclusion This study emphasized the importance of providing people living with early-stage dementia educational opportunities that combine first-hand information, peer and facilitator support, reminiscing, humor, recognition, and validation. These interventions can contribute to promote coping, healthy behaviors, and empowerment in people living with early-stage dementia.",

      "abstract": "Within festivals and events, film festivals are among the fastest growing cultural events in the world and are recognised as bringing environmental, sociocultural and economic benefits to host tourism destinations including enhanced well-being. These festivals are an important marketing strategy for developing destination image and attracting interest towards a destination. However, there are limited studies on the film festival experience exploring the antecedents of participants\u2019 satisfaction. This study examines the relationship between eudaimonic feelings, novelty, local culture, nostalgia, perceived quality, satisfaction, and behavioural intentions. Data were gathered during the last 3 days of the Penedo Film in the City of Penedo , Northeast Brazil using a questionnaire. A total of 97 valid questionnaires were collected from the festival attendees. Findings show that only eudaimonic feelings and perceived quality are predictors of satisfaction. To the best of authors knowledge, this study is the first to examine the perceived experience of participants in a film festival context from a positive psychology perspective and providing further empirical support for construct validity of eudaimonic feelings. The findings contribute to the existing tourism literature on film festivals by identifying key antecedents (eudaimonic feelings and perceived quality) and outcomes (behavioural intentions) of satisfaction with film festival. One of the main managerial implications includes engaging film festival participants in co-creation processes and in promoting group discussions about a specific movie with an appealing and social relevant theme.",

Most of the interventions targeted research conduct, primarily focussed on registration, publishing, and reporting. Most included studies used observational evaluation methods. Categorising the interventions by the behaviour change wheel framework we found that most studies utilised restriction, coercion, and persuasion and fewer used enablement, training, or incentivisation to achieve their aims.

The focus was on decisions that affect the psychological and social well-being of responders and community members. Communities of EOC personnel participated in a simulated emergency event, followed by an interview and/or focus group. Analysis of the decision-making processes during the simulation revealed that most operational decisions were made intuitively, with expertise, and best modeled by RPD. When the decisions involved issues for which EOC personnel had less experience (e.g., psychosocial issues), the decision-making approach shifted from a fast intuitive style to a more deliberative style. In some cases, EOC staff requested additional information before making a decision. With no formalized feedback loops, decisions were delayed or not made at all, leaving community residents and EOC personnel without psychosocial services for unnecessary lengths of time. The researchers found the RPD model to be most useful in its potential for identifying areas where future training (i.e., simulated exercises) and education (i.e., knowledge transfer) could be offered to EOC personnel to improve the provision of psychosocial services.",

      "abstract": "Child sexual abuse (CSA) is a major social and public health issue that creates short- and long-lasting impacts on victims, families, and society. While global researchers have considered the topic of CSA since the 19th century, the Nigerian context has been largely ignored. Yet, without sufficient evidence and understanding, making changes to practices and policies becomes almost impossible. The review aimed to gain insights into the nature and extent of CSA and identify areas for improvement in practice and research in Nigeria. This article presents the findings of a systematic review of 31 empirical articles related to CSA in Nigeria. Using key search terms along Boolean operators and truncation, PubMed, PsycINFO, CINAHL, ASSIA, PILOTS, African Journals Online, and Google Scholar were searched. A total of 1,325 studies were found, and 31 empirical studies, including 20 quantitative, 9 qualitative, and 2 mixed methods studies, were included. The review findings reveal the discourse on CSA and delve into various aspects such as its prevalence, manifestation patterns, root causes, management, and consequential impact on victims and societal domains. The gaps in the existing literature are identified and explored to identify areas for improvement in victim services, societal awareness, and healthcare practices and relevant policies. The sociocultural norms not only heightened children\u2019s vulnerability to sexual abuse but also posed significant barriers to them disclosing such abuse. Survivors of CSA often receive inadequate care, indicating a pressing need for improvements in this area. Implications for research, policy, and conclusion were discussed.",

      "abstract": "Background Carpal tunnel syndrome is a common condition, but some controversies remain regarding diagnostics and the most effective treatments. As a result, patients often experience decisional conflicts, especially when considering carpal tunnel release surgery. Understanding factors that influence decision-making in surgery can help clinicians better grasp patient treatment preferences and priorities, reducing decisional conflicts, and enabling patients to make informed, value-aligned choices through shared decision-making. This qualitative evidence synthesis aims to explore patient perceptions of carpal tunnel release, examine the decision-making factors, and critically appraise and synthesise the existing evidence. Methods A systematic search was conducted across four electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL Ultimate, PsycINFO) from inception to August 2023, supplemented by referencing and citation searching to identify eligible qualitative studies. Thematic synthesis was adopted as synthesis methodology, involving a line-by-line coding of the primary study findings, and the development of descriptive and analytical themes. Quality appraisal was conducted using the modified Critical Appraisal Skills Programme checklist, supplemented with the COnsolidated criteria for REporting Qualitative research checklist. Results Synthesis of six qualitative studies encompassing 66 participants generated five analytical themes: (1) Journey to normalcy, (2) Patient-centred care, (3) Work and life considerations, (4) Weighing up alternatives, and (5) Shaping the expectations, highlighting the complexity of patient decision-making in carpal tunnel release. Discussion In the management of carpal tunnel syndrome, therapists should consider various decision-making factors, prioritising communication and shared decision-making. This, along with personalised interactions, achieves patient-centred care and enhances patient care quality and therapeutic alliance.",

      "abstract": "This paper presents an analysis of how three interlocutors sequentially organize and accomplish mutual understanding in naturally occurring audiovisual recordings of therapy sessions. The analysis is in keeping with microanalysis of face-to-face dialog (MFD) and follows operational definitions of three-step micro-processes that interlocutors use when they calibrate new information; that is, how they agree that they have understood each other\u2019s words and actions well enough for current practical purposes. Pointing to some of the complexities that characterize triadic interactions, the analysis contributes with new documentations of \u2018suspended\u2019, \u2018nested\u2019, \u2018branched\u2019, \u2018multi-paced\u2019, and \u2018mixed interpretations\u2019 calibrations. The analysis also demonstrates how interlocutors may calibrate the \u2018tone\u2019 of an utterance before the topical content is mutually understood. The results and their implications may be relevant to practitioners of institutional talks at large, where the quality and outcome of, for instance, assessments and interventions largely rely on accomplishing mutual understanding.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Therapeutic possibilities for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) have considerably increased during recent decades. OBJECTIVE: To summarize the prognostic relevance of serum tumor markers (STM) for early and late-stage NSCLC patients treated with classical chemotherapies, novel targeted and immune therapies. METHODS: A PubMed database search was conducted for prognostic studies on carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), cytokeratin-19 fragment (CYFRA 21-1), neuron-specific enolase, squamous-cell carcinoma antigen, progastrin-releasing-peptide, CA125, CA 19-9 and CA 15-3 STMs in NSCLC patients published from 2008 until June 2022. RESULTS: Out of 1069 studies, 141 were identified as meeting the inclusion criteria. A considerable heterogeneity regarding design, patient number, analytical and statistical methods was observed. High pretherapeutic CYFRA 21-1 levels and insufficient decreases indicated unfavorable prognosis in many studies on NSCLC patients treated with chemo-, targeted and immunotherapies or their combinations in early and advanced stages. Similar results were seen for CEA in chemotherapy, however, high pretherapeutic levels were sometimes favorable in targeted therapies. CA125 is a promising prognostic marker in patients treated with immunotherapies. Combinations of STMs further increased the prognostic value over single markers. CONCLUSION: Protein STMs, especially CYFRA 21-1, have prognostic potential in early and advanced stage NSCLC. For future STM investigations, better adherence to comparable study designs, analytical methods, outcome measures and statistical evaluation standards is recommended.",

      "abstract": "Playing-related musculoskeletal disorders (PRMDs) are highly prevalent among concert pianists due to the unique sociological and historical predispositions of the instrument. Although current literature explores PRMD risk factors in isolation, few studies have explored the complex interdependencies that exist between the procedural and postural practices of pianists. This study aims to reframe this discussion by holistically exploring how common educational principles in phalangeal curvature, wrist flexion range of motion, and technical exercises interact to precipitate in PRMDs. The practices of the Lhevinne and Taubman schools were comparatively evaluated through kinematic studies to discern potential biomechanical stresses, and the findings were compared with current empirical evidence to ascertain links to PRMDs. The findings from this review indicate pedagogical susceptibility patterns may be more nuanced than the claims of stakeholders. However, studies suggest that practitioners of the Lhevinne school should incorporate phalangeal postures with active flexion to reduce susceptibility to tendinitis, osteoarthritis, and carpal tunnel syndrome. Practitioners of the Taubman school should further apply low-intensity technical exercises for warm-ups to increase muscle flexibility and facilitate temperature-related benefits to performance. However, high-intensity exercises at the Lhevinne school such as consecutive intervals and flexibility studies are contrary to current biomechanical observations.",

      "abstract": "Representation, primarily understood as 'presence' or 'appearance' with an implied visual component, is a critical concept in the cultural milieu. Conceived as images, performances, and imitations, representations propagate through various media: films, television, photographs, advertisements, and other forms of popular culture. As such, representations of mental illness perform a pivotal role in framing perceptions about the mentally ill. These representations influence and shape public perceptions about the illness. This essay aims to analyze how mental illness is perceived, represented, and treated in popular culture and medical discourses. In so doing, the essay lays bare the ideologies and the symbolic codes that undergird these representations and the consequent stigma confronted by the mentally ill. Taking these cues, the essay close reads popular representations of mental illness in movies, newspapers, advertisements, comics, and paintings and the articulation of stereotyped images of the mentally ill in a medical discourse which externalize madness in distorted physiognomic features. In so doing, the essay exposes the negative implications of these representations on the personal and social lives of the mentally ill and negotiates the significance of personal accounts of mental illness experience as a means of reclaiming their identity",

      "abstract": "Background: Pulmonary rehabilitation is a highly evidenced intervention used in the management ofpatients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Both patients and healthcare professionals have anecdotally acknowledged motivation as a key element in a programme. It has been suggested by some authors that motivation should be a prerequisite to entry, yet there is no evidence to support this suggestion. The purpose ofthis study therefore, was to provide some theory about the role of motivation in pulmonary rehabilitation and to produce a measurement instrument to enable further quantitative study. Methods: A qualitative, exploratory investigation using focus gro~ps and face-to-face interviews with patients undergoing a pulmonary rehabilitation programme was undertaken to generate data around factors influencing motivation. Results were used to develop a 43 item self-report questionnaire. The questionnaire was administered to 77 patients before and after a pulmonary rehabilitation programme along with other health status measures. The questionnaire was tested for reliability apd validity. Item reduction was perfonned using factor analysis. Results: Motivation within the context ofa PR programme was shown to consist of a number of psychological, social and circumstantial variables that fell into 3 broad dimensions: Essential motivation, external motivation and functional outcome. A key fmding was that attending pulmonary rehabilitation had an enonnous positive influence on the patients' essential motivation. The questionnaire was reduced to 21 items and principal components analysis demonstrated 9 factors within the questionnaire. These were function, self-efficacy, effort, optimism, tenacity, se1fworth, isolation, ability and achievement. The questionnaire was named the Malvern pulmonary rehabilitation motivation questionnaire (MPMQ) for identification. The MPMQ was sho~ to be reliable with internal consistency, reproducibility on test-retest and sensitivity to change. Correlations were found between the MPMQ and health related quality of life, anxiety and depression, breathlessness, exercise capacity and hospital admissions during the previous 12 months. Motivation score was significantly lower in patients",

      "abstract": "Policing by its very nature has been widely recognised as being inherently stressful with little that can be done to prevent police officers\u2019 exposure to both primary and secondary trauma. Officers involved in the investigation of child abuse and sexual offences have been further recognised as working in some of the most stressful and demanding roles in policing. However, there has been little research within this high-risk group of officers which seeks to understand how they cope with both the organisational and occupational stressors they are exposed to, as well as which strategies help them to \u2018 get up in the morning \u2019. Data were collected through twenty-three (23) semi-structured interviews, with Straussian Grounded Theory used as a framework to develop a model of coping. This study highlighted that although some officers were affected by the traumatic nature of their work, there were other risk factors present which appear to have impacted on them more significantly including \u2018burnout\u2019, \u2019compassion fatigue\u2019 and \u2018moral injury\u2019. Protective factors were identified as \u2018being in control\u2019, \u2018organisational, social and peer support\u2019 as well as \u2018having a purpose\u2019 all of which impacted on an officer\u2019s ability to cope with the work they do. The present findings extend our knowledge of key concepts relating to police officer coping which may help officers working in these high-risk roles to cope with challenges they face daily. Recommendations for further research on how to support this group of officers, as well as implications for practice are discussed.",

However, there are limited data on the range and specifics of potential barriers that withhold people in headache medicine and science from reaching their full potential. Moreover, people from different geographical regions often perceive different challenges. We aimed to identify world-wide perceived career barriers and possibilities for promoting equality amongst professionals in the headache fields. Methods A cross-sectional online survey was conducted among professionals in the field of headache globally. The questions of the survey were aimed at assessing perceived career barriers in four domains: professional recognition, opportunities in scientific societies, clinical practice, and salary and compensation. Perceived mentorship was also assessed. Results In total 580 responders completed the survey (55.3% women). Gender was the most important perceived barrier in almost all domains. Additionally, country of birth emerged as an important barrier to participation in international scientific societies. Career barriers varied across world regions. Conclusion It is essential that longstanding and ongoing disparities by gender and country of origin for professionals in the headache field are globally acknowledged and addressed in areas of recruitment, retention, opportunities, mentor- and sponsorships, and advancement.",

This study compares various palatopharyngeal surgery techniques without tonsillectomy for reducing the apnea\u2010hypopnea index (AHI). Data Sources Embase, MEDLINE, Web of Science, ClinicalTrials, CINAHL, the Cochrane Library, and International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. Review Methods We included studies of palatopharyngeal surgery in adults reporting AHI outcomes, excluding those with tonsillectomy or combined surgeries. A random\u2010effects model was used to pool effect sizes. Surgical techniques were categorized into cold steel, muscle relocation, suture, radiofrequency, laser, powered instruments, and implants. The primary outcome was the reduction in AHI. Secondary outcomes were the AHI responder rate, AHI reduction over the follow\u2010up duration, and the outcomes by publication year. Results From 3793 screened records, 45 studies with 1501 patients were included. Overall, palatopharyngeal surgery reduced AHI by 5.2/h (95% CI, 2.7\u20107.7; P &lt; .0001). Powered instruments showed the greatest AHI reduction (26.3/h; 95% CI, 18.9\u201033.7), followed by muscle relocation (20.2/h; 95% CI, 3.7\u201036.7) and suture techniques (15.3/h; 95% CI, 9.6\u201021.0). Palatal implants (2.6/h; 95% CI, 0.4\u20104.7) and laser techniques (4.5/h; 95% CI, 1.3\u20107.8) showed modest effects, whereas radiofrequency (0.4/h; 95% CI, \u22122.0 to 2.8) and cold steel (6.6/h; 95% CI, \u22120.2 to 13.5) had no significant impact. The overall responder rate was 51% (95% CI, 41\u201060), with powered instruments, relocation, and suture techniques demonstrating the highest rates. Conclusion Palatopharyngeal surgery techniques significantly differ in reducing AHI. Powered instruments, muscle relocation, and suture techniques are most effective.

      "abstract": "This study explores the effectiveness of qualitative projective techniques to explore the corporate political brand image of Pakistan Tehreek-I-Insaf party [PTI] from a multiple-stakeholder perspective. This study addresses core gaps in projective techniques research of eliciting responses from a large cross-section of multiple stakeholders in varied non-western contexts. A qualitative interpretivist approach was adopted. More specifically, expressive projective techniques were embedded within focus group discussions. Nine focus group discussions (comprising 37 participants) were carried out in Karachi and Lahore (Pakistan) from June to November 2020. Each focus group lasted 60 to 90 minutes. A six-phased contextualist thematic analytical approach was employed to interpret the findings generated from the projective techniques and subsequent discussions. Projective techniques were established as an efficient and effective tool for exploring corporate political brand image research in Pakistan. The leadership element of the corporate political brand trinity was revealed to be larger than policies and party and it had both positive associations as well as being perceived as opportunistic. Policies were associated with dissatisfaction and incompetence whereas, the party element of the brand was viewed as ineffective and a subordinate brand. This study addresses explicit calls for further insights and research on the use of projective techniques in dynamic contexts and settings. In addition, this research adds to the limited understanding of the choice of stimuli and appraisal of projective techniques. Finally, this study provides a systematic ten-step guide entitled the projective techniques toolkit which outlines how to successfully conduct research using projective techniques. This research and developed toolkit will benefit practitioners and academics alike.",

      "abstract": "Background. It is a patient\u2019s right to be included in decisions about their health care. Implementing shared decision making (SDM) is important to enable active communication between clinicians and patients. Although health policy makers are increasingly mandating SDM implementation, SDM adoption has been slow. This study explored stakeholders\u2019 organizational- and system-level barriers and facilitators to implementing policy mandated SDM in maternity care in Victoria, Australia. Method. Twenty-four semi-structured interviews were conducted with participants including clinicians, health service administrators and decision makers, and government policy makers. Data were mapped to the Theoretical Domains Framework to identify barriers and facilitators to SDM implementation. Results. Factors identified as facilitating SDM implementation included using a whole-of-system approach, providing additional implementation resources, correct documentation facilitated by electronic medical records, and including patient outcomes in measurement. Barriers included health service lack of capacity, unclear policy definitions of SDM, and policy makers\u2019 lack of resources to track implementation. Conclusion. This is the first study to our knowledge to explore barriers and facilitators to SDM implementation from the perspective of multiple actors following policy mandating SDM in tertiary health services in Australia. The primary finding was that there are concerns that SDM implementation policy is outpacing practice. Nonclinical staff play a crucial role translating policy to practice. Addressing organizational- and system-level barriers and facilitators to SDM implementation should be a key concern of health policy makers, health services, and staff. Highlights New government policies require shared decision making (SDM) implementation in hospitals. There is limited evidence for how to implement SDM in hospital settings. There are concerns SDM implementation policy is outpacing practice. Understanding and capacity for SDM varies considerably among stakeholders. Whole of system approaches and electronic medical records are seen to facilitate SDM.",

      "abstract": "Students who seemingly do not fit the masculine ideal of an entrepreneur rarely consider entrepreneurship as a suitable career path due to a lack of identification and perceived feasibility. To challenge the masculinization of entrepreneurship, we drew from contemporary literature on gender role stereotypes to design a course that enables business and management educators to foster entrepreneurial aspirations among all genders. To that end, we introduce and evaluate a variety of pedagogical nudges that help raise awareness of and dismantle the stereotypical beliefs that deem masculine characteristics necessary to succeed in an entrepreneurial career. Results from 122 students and scientists who participated in the course show that these nudges, including the androgynous representation of entrepreneurship and the creation of safe spaces, help participants transform their views on who and what is involved in entrepreneurship. Our discussion underscores the importance of addressing gender role stereotypes in entrepreneurship education as a means to increase the pool of individuals who can identify with the role of a startup founder and to de-bias the allocation of resources in venture creation processes.",

      "abstract": "Men represent a proportion of those with eating disorders yet are neglected in the existing literature. One area with limited research is how men with eating disorders experience body image. This study investigated how men with eating disorders make sense of their experience of body image. Ten male participants with diagnosed eating disorders were recruited from four National Health Service specialist adult eating disorder services. Semi-structured interviews were conducted, and data analysed with Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis. Analysis identified three themes: \u2018Focus on Self\u2019, \u2018Focus on Others\u2019 and \u2018Systemic Influences and Pressures\u2019. Findings indicated that body image was experienced intrapersonally, interpersonally, and systemically. This study adds to the limited accounts of body image among men with eating disorders. It is recommended that future research explore body image in underrepresented gender and sexuality groups and that clinicians incorporate the nuances of men\u2019s experiences of body image into clinical assessment and treatment.",

      "abstract": "Intellectual colonisation is defined as the imposition of Western knowledge systems onto non-Western cultures, resulting in the marginalisation and subordination of non-Western beliefs, practices, and technologies. Decolonisation aims to challenge this dominance. Higher Education Institutions play a crucial role in dismantling intellectual colonisation, and sustained efforts are needed to promote diverse perspectives. The authors adopt a critical pedagogy and cyclical improvement approach to develop inclusive and equitable learning environments. They have committed to the process of decolonising the curriculum, acknowledging it as ongoing and multifaceted. A range of staff-led developments have been initiated as understandings of decolonisation have deepened. Alumni have applied review tools related to decolonising the curriculum to identify potential improvement areas. A student workshop was facilitated to overview the initial project developments and gain insight on how to address the issues identified. Feedback from the diverse student cohort indicated this was highly valuable. The potential for student-staff partnerships in driving decolonising efforts has begun to be explored, but key challenges include resource constraints and the need for student upskilling. The project goal is to empower students and staff to acknowledge their positionality, critically engage, and adopt a decolonial lens in both educational and workplace arenas.",

The electronic Integrated Palliative Care Outcome Scale (e-IPOS) in this context enables thorough self-assessment by patients, enhancing symptom management and self-reflection of their current situation. Aim To evaluate the feasibility of implementing the e-IPOS in home palliative cancer care. Outcomes The primary outcomes included the enrollment consent rate, study retention rate, e-IPOS completion rate and response completeness, and the number of clinical assessments and interventions performed during home visits. The secondary outcomes were the number of unscheduled visits and patients\u2019 perceived quality of life. Design A two-group quasiexperimental clinical pilot study. The control group received standard palliative care, the intervention group received standard care along with weekly e-IPOS completion during home visits. Both groups were enrolled for 4 weeks. Setting/participants Adults with advanced cancer from the home palliative care unit of the Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori of Milan. Results Twenty-three patients were enrolled (74.19%), and 20 completed the study (drop-out: 13.04%). 82.5% of the expected e-IPOS responses were received, of which 96.9% were fully complete. In the intervention group, the Wilcoxon test showed an increase in identified needs and documented interventions ( P &lt; .05) and a decrease in unscheduled visits ( P &lt; .05). Conclusion It is feasible to recruit people via home palliative care for an e-IPOS implementation study. Future fully powered studies should investigate the feasibility and assess patients\u2019 perceptions of its use to better understand its clinical benefits.",

An attempt was made to explore the relationship between the glare subjective responses and actual contrast sensitivity. Thirty-six individuals (9 high neuroticism scorers, 9 low neuroticism scorers, 9 high extraversion scorers, and 9 low extraversion scorers) were tested on subjective discomfort glare rating responses and visual contrast sensitivity. The International Personality Item Pool (IPIP) was used to assess trait-based individual differences, while the subjective glare experience was examined utilizing modified glare De Boer discomfort rating scale. The visual performance was measured through the contrast sensitivity level using adjustable contrast level of the Landolt's C target. Results indicated significant effect of extraversion trait on rating response while insignificant effect on visual related performance. The relationship between rating response and visual performance was also found to be quite minimal. In conclusion, the expected model was supported but only on the extraversion trait. Overall, the research was directed towards improving our understanding of influencing factors on the experience of discomfort glare, which may eventually have practical implications in the design of glare measurement methods, training and selection of drivers and workers who work under conditions of glare.",

We wanted to explore differences in pain communication with a special interest in potential sex differences. Patients visiting our headache unit for the first time filled in two different questionnaires (one before entering the consultation and one directly after finishing the consultation), through which we captured patients\u2019 descriptions of their pain, its potential impact on daily lives, the well-being of our patients and the satisfaction with our consultation. We included a total of 35 patients (22 female, 13 male). Women reported experiencing a greater loss of socially active days during the last 3 months because of headaches compared to men. Furthermore, women were more satisfied with our consultation. In addition, we revealed migraineurs characterize their pain differently than stated in the International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD-3) criteria. The adjective \u201cpressing\u201d (dr\u00fcckend) was used significantly more often by migraineurs compared to patients with tension-type headaches. Nevertheless, in the physicians\u2019 written report, the characterization more often contained the ICHD-3 corresponding adjective \u201cpulsating\u201d (pulsierend). Since the typification of headaches and subsequent therapy depends predominantly on the patients\u2019 communication, consideration of the individual pain description and further research on headache characterization are indispensable.",

Background: Practicing good HH in non-medical office settings is vital to curb the spread of a range of common and infectious diseases. Despite this, workers are rarely consulting in the construction of HH messages. The qualitative views of users can provide us with the \u201cwhy\u201d rather than the \u201cwhat\u201d and can highlight areas of cynicism, concern and overall attitudes to HH. Methods: A survey was completed by 520 UK workers concerning attitudes and views toward HH messaging and the use of a video-based hand sanitizer unit. Analysis consisted of both qualitative and quantitative methods. Results: Workers were skeptical toward the use of digital technologies within HH interventions, and there were misgivings about the role that video could play. Results demonstrated a strong preference for positive and supportive messages. Educational and trustworthy qualities were well rated. Messages that emphasized surveillance, previously successful in a clinical setting, or guilt, were not well received. Visual approaches that utilized serious illustration were valued. Conclusion: This study highlights how consulting workers before the design of HH initiatives is important in guiding the design process. The resultant user-centered criteria promotes the use of positive, motivational, thought-provoking, surprising, and visual approaches to HH messaging.",

      "abstract": "In 2007, the WHO and UNAIDS established male circumcision as the first surgery ever implemented as a preventive health policy, via their Voluntary Medical Male Circumcision (VMMC) anti-HIV programme that delivered 18.6 million circumcisions in Southern and Eastern Africa by 2017. This article investigates how this genital ritual became a global health policy taking discourse as the entry point. Based on a mixed-method research design, we argue that global health International Organisations are at the forefront of the latest stage of a meaning-making process started in the 19th century: the transnational resemantisation of male circumcision into a medical procedure. First, we introduce the concept of resemantisation to the study of International Relations. Second, we conduct a computational discourse analysis of 396 VMMC policy documents and demonstrate the discursive mechanisms through which they play a role in this process. Third, we combine primary and secondary data to trace the transnational history of the circulation of medicalised male circumcision until its implementation as a global health policy. Overall, we introduce resemantisation as an analytical and methodological framework that nuances our understanding of meaning-making processes and builds bridges between the study of discourses and practices.",

However, the setting \u2013 meditating alone or in dyads \u2013 and its impact on the effects of meditation have not yet been examined. We expected that dyadic compassion meditation (CM) may improve perceived social closeness more compared to closely-matched individual CM. N = 50 couples were randomly assigned to do a brief 15-min CM induction either together with their partner or individually. Social closeness was rated by both partners. Secondary outcomes were positive and negative affect as well as parasympathetic response, indicated by heart rate variability (HRV). Due to the dyadic data structure, multilevel models were tested. We found no difference between dyadic and individual CM in self-report. After both forms social closeness and positive affect were improved, while negative affect decreased. Only HRV differed between the two conditions over time: while HRV significantly decreased in the individual condition, there was no such change in the dyadic condition. The accompanying physiological profile suggests that CM may involve effort at least in the individual CM. Done individually or with a partner, brief CM can foster social closeness and improve affect and can be employed to improve socio-emotional well-being.",

      "abstract": "Background. While nerve and tendon transfer surgery can restore upper extremity function and independence after midcervical spinal cord injury, few individuals (\u223c14%) undergo surgery. There is limited information regarding these complex and time-sensitive treatment options. Patient decision aids (PtDAs) convey complex health information and help individuals make informed, preference-consistent choices. The purpose of this study is to evaluate a newly created PtDA for people with spinal cord injury who are considering options to optimize upper extremity function. Methods. The PtDA was developed by our multidisciplinary group based on clinical evidence and the Ottawa Decision Support Framework. A prospective pilot study enrolled adults with midcervical spinal cord injury to evaluate the PtDA. Participants completed surveys about knowledge and decisional conflict before and after viewing the PtDA. Acceptability measures and suggestions for further improvement were also solicited. Results. Forty-two individuals were enrolled and completed study procedures. Participants had a 20% increase in knowledge after using the PtDA ( P &lt; 0.001). The number of participants experiencing decisional conflict decreased after viewing the PtDA (33 v. 18, P = 0.001). Acceptability was high. To improve the PtDA, participants suggested adding details about specific surgeries and outcomes. Limitations. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we used an entirely virtual study methodology and recruited participants from national networks and organizations. Most participants were older than the general population with a new spinal cord injury and may have different injury causes than typical surgical candidates. Conclusions. A de novo PtDA improved knowledge of treatment options and reduced decisional conflict about reconstructive surgery among people with cervical spinal cord injury. Future work should explore PtDA use for improving knowledge and decisional conflict in the nonresearch, clinical setting. Highlights People with cervical spinal cord injury prioritize gaining upper extremity function after injury, but few individuals receive information about treatment options. A newly created patient decision aid (PtDA) provides information about recovery after spinal cord injury and the role of traditional tendon and newer nerve transfer surgery to improve upper extremity upper extremity function. The PtDA improved knowledge and decreased decisional conflict in this pilot study. Future work should focus on studying dissemination and implementation of the ptDA into clinical practice.",

      "abstract": "Infant mental health (IMH) is a growing area of practice for health, education and social care practitioners, as links are increasingly made between experiences in the early years and subsequent child development, mental health and well-being. It is unclear how parents perceive IMH and use knowledge relating to IMH with their children. We conducted a systematic review, the aim of which was to determine parents\u2019 perceptions of IMH and how they utilize this knowledge with their infants. We undertook a search of relevant databases and journals and from an initial list of 4147 potential papers, identified 16 for the review. Original data were extracted and presented in a table, and the content of all papers was analysed thematically and presented in narrative form. Three main themes emerged from the available research: knowledge and understanding of child development, influences of society and culture, and interpretation of emotions and expressions. Our results indicate that research is limited in terms of parental perspectives of IMH and how they obtain and use this knowledge. Further research is needed to investigate this topic to maximize mental well-being in infancy and later life.",

      "abstract": "Background People with comorbidities are under-represented in randomised controlled trials, and it is unknown whether patterns of comorbidity are similar in trials and the community. Methods Individual-level participant data were obtained for 83 clinical trials (54,688 participants) for 16 index conditions from two trial repositories: Yale University Open Data Access (YODA) and the Centre for Global Clinical Research Data (Vivli). Community data (860,177 individuals) were extracted from the Secure Anonymised Information Linkage (SAIL) databank for the same index conditions. Comorbidities were defined using concomitant medications. For each index condition, we estimated correlations between comorbidities separately in trials and community data. For the six commonest comorbidities we estimated all pairwise correlations using Bayesian multivariate probit models, conditioning on age and sex. Correlation estimates from trials with the same index condition were combined into a single estimate. We then compared the trial and community estimates for each index condition. Results Despite a higher prevalence of comorbidities in the community than in trials, the correlations between comorbidities were mostly similar in both settings. On comparing correlations between the community and trials, 21% of correlations were stronger in the community, 10% were stronger in the trials and 68% were similar in both. In the community, 5% of correlations were negative, 21% were null, 56% were weakly positive and 18% were strongly positive. Equivalent results for the trials were 11%, 33%, 45% and 10% respectively. Conclusions Comorbidity correlations are generally similar in both the trials and community, providing some evidence for the reporting of comorbidity-specific findings from clinical trials.",

Return to work with chronic pain: employers\u2019 and employees\u2019 views. Occupational Medicine 2013: doi:0.1093/occmed/kqt109. The conference homepage is here; http://www.som-asm.org.uk/Programme_SOM_ASM.asp Abstract Background The sickness certification and return to work (RTW) of people with chronic pain are important health and economic issues for employees, employers, taxpayers and the UK government. The \u2018fit note\u2019 and a national educational programme promoting RTW were introduced in 2010 to curb rising rates of sickness absence. Aims To investigate employers\u2019 and employees\u2019 experiences of managing RTW when someone has taken sick leave for chronic pain, and to explore the perceived efficacy of the fit note. Methods A qualitative study, comprising semi-structured interviews with employers who had managed sick leave cases and employees who had experienced sick leave for chronic pain. Interviews were recorded, transcribed and the data analysed using constructivist grounded theory principles. Results Five themes were elicited. Firstly, frequent enquiry after health status was seen as intrusive by some employees but part of good practice by employers and acknowledging this difference was useful. Secondly, being able to trust employees due to their performance track record was helpful for employers when dealing with complex chronic pain conditions. Thirdly, feeling valued increased employees\u2019 motivation to return to work. Fourthly, guidelines about maintaining contact with absent employees were useful if used flexibly. Finally, both parties valued the fit note for its positive language, interrogative format and biomedical authority. Conclusions The fit note was perceived to be helpful if used in combination with other strategies for managing sick leave and RTW for people with chronic pain. These strategies may be applicable to other fluctuating, long-term conditions with medically unexplained elements.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Objective To evaluate the efficacy of theophylline in acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and provide evidence\u2010based clinical guidance. Methods Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on theophylline for acute COPD exacerbations were retrieved from PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge Internet, and Wanfang Database (through November 2024). Studies were screened and data extracted per inclusion criteria. Quality was assessed via the Cochrane risk\u2010of\u2010bias tool; meta\u2010analysis used R 4.2.2. Results This meta\u2010analysis ultimately included eight RCTs comprising 3133 participants, with 1582 patients allocated to the theophylline experimental group and 1551 to the control group (placebo, normal saline, or standard care). The analysis demonstrated that theophylline significantly improved the clinical treatment efficacy rate\u2014defined as a composite outcome incorporating symptom alleviation, sign reduction, and arterial blood gas improvement\u2014compared to controls (odds ratio [OR] = 3.96, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.41\u20136.50; p &lt; 0.01). Additionally, theophylline significantly increased partial pressure of arterial oxygen levels (mean difference [MD] = 0.08 mmHg, 95% CI: 0.06\u20130.11; p &lt; 0.01). However, no statistically significant intergroup differences were observed for the partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide (PaCO 2 ; MD = 0.32 mmHg, 95% CI: \u22120.04 to 0.68; p = 0.08), forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV 1 ; MD = 0.19 L, 95% CI: \u22120.10 to 0.48; p = 0.20), FEV 1 /forced vital capacity ratio (MD = 10.26%, 95% CI: \u22122.81 to 23.33; p = 0.12), or adverse reaction incidence (OR = 0.74, 95% CI: 0.36\u20131.51; p = 0.41). Conclusion Based on the current evidence, theophylline can improve clinical outcomes in acute exacerbations of COPD without increasing adverse effects. However, given the limited number of included studies and potential confounding factors, these findings require further validation through well\u2010designed, high\u2010quality RCTs.",

To be included in the sample, persons needed to: (1) be \u2a7e18 years old, (2) report past year lean use, (3) complete lean use screeners, and (4) pass data quality checks (eg, bot detection). As Reddit is an online forum, no geographic restrictions were placed on study participation. Data on demographic characteristics, lean use, and mental health disorder symptomology were captured from participants. Logistic regression models included anxiety, depression, and trauma as independent variables along with covariates to examine using lean to cope with emotions, thoughts, or feelings in the past 30 days. Most participants were male (n = 1102; 77.4%), with an average age of 26.9 (SD = 5.2) years. Most participants used included codeine as an ingredient in lean (n = 1060; 74.5%); promethazine was added as an ingredient by 31.7% of the sample (n = 451), and the combination of codeine and promethazine was included as ingredients by 13.5% (n = 192) of the sample.

      "abstract": "Background After talocrural arthrodesis, adjacent joints (subtalar, talonavicular, and calcaneocuboid) are often affected by osteoarthritis (OA)). It is unclear if OA is pre-existing to talocrural arthrodesis, or whether it develops after talocrural arthrodesis. This retrospective study is unique because it is the first study with preoperative and follow-up computed tomography (CT). The aim of this study is to investigate whether OA develops in adjacent joints after talocrural arthrodesis or if OA is already pre-existing. In addition, associations between degree of OA and patient-reported outcomes are investigated. Methods Patients were selected from electronic files, and adjacent joint OA was assessed on preoperative CT and bilateral follow-up CT. Patient-reported outcomes were collected. Results Twenty-three patients were included with an average follow-up time of 7 years (SD = 2). In participants without pre-existing OA, OA significantly progressed in all adjacent joints. In participants with pre-existing OA, OA progressed in the subtalar joint. Patient-reported outcomes were not correlated to OA. Conclusions Osteoarthritis in the adjacent joints progresses after talocrural arthrodesis, especially in participants without pre-existing OA. The severity of OA is not related to patient-reported outcomes. Therefore, the clinical impact of the progression of OA seems to be limited. Level of Evidence: Level III: retrospective",

      "abstract": "In this photovoice study, we explored how people with multiple sclerosis (MS) experience living with and managing invisible symptoms in daily life. Twelve people with MS produced digital images over a 2-week period to capture their experiences of invisible symptoms. Participants then discussed their images in semistructured interviews. We thematically analyzed the interviews and developed three main themes that encompass the difficulties around conceptualizing invisible symptoms and the conflicts of legitimacy this presents for people with MS, in which the reality of their invisible symptoms is invalidated by others and sometimes for themselves. Participants navigated these issues in dynamic ways, choosing to fit their symptoms to their lives or make space for their symptoms depending on the context, often influenced by a desire to \u201cstay invisible\u201d or to \u201cbe seen.\u201d We highlight clinical implications for supporting people with MS around the legitimacy conflicts they experience and how they negotiate living with invisible symptoms.",

      "title": "Changes in processing speed during early abstinence from alcohol dependence",
      "abstract": "Background: Processing speed is a task-independent construct underpinning more complex goal-related abilities. Processing speed is impaired in alcohol dependence (AD) and is linked to relapse, as are the functions it underpins. Reliable measurement of processing speed may allow tracking of AD recovery trajectories and identify patients requiring additional support. Aims: To assess changes in reaction time (RT) from baseline (at the start of a detoxification programme) across early abstinence. Methods: Vibrotactile RT was assessed in early recovery between days 3 and 7 of treatment in 66 individuals with AD (25 females; aged 19\u201374, 44.60 \u00b1 10.60 years) and against 35 controls tested on one occasion (19 females; 41.00 \u00b1 13.60), using two multivariate multiple regressions. A mixed multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA) of available AD data ( n = 45) assessed change in RT between timepoints and between treatment settings (outpatient vs inpatient). Results: The group (AD vs control) significantly predicted choice RT at baseline and follow-up but did not significantly predict simple RT or RT variability, which is inconsistent with previous findings. At follow-up, mental fatigue was also predicted by the group, and MANCOVA indicated that this had worsened in inpatients but improved in outpatients. Conclusions: Recovery of RT measures so early in the treatment journey was not in line with previous research which indicates persisting deficits. The interaction between setting and timepoint indicates that despite being typically less medically complex, outpatients require ongoing support and monitoring during their recovery.",

      "abstract": "Objective: To investigate the effectiveness of a mindfulness based stress reduction (MBSR) program on self reported pain, acceptance, resilience and quality of life in a mixed chronic pain population. Design: A single cohort observational study with pre-post measures. Setting: Community based program located in the Sunshine Coast, Queensland, Australia. Participants: Fifteen volunteers (1 male, 14 female; mean age=52.9y) with a history of chronic musculoskeletal pain referred from local healthcare providers. Methods: People who experienced chronic pain of a musculoskeletal origin and/or mild to moderate rheumatoid arthritis and who were interested in exploring the potential health benefits of mindfulness meditation were enrolled in the study. Participants were enrolled in an 8-week program of Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR). Participants were required to attend a 2-hour group session once a week led by a qualified MBSR teacher and complete home practice in addition to daily mindfulness. Participants completed electronic questionnaires for each of the outcome measures at baseline, post intervention and 1, 2, and 3 months post intervention. Results: Perceived pain intensity: Clinically significant changes (&gt;5 points) in the median MPQ score was observed at pre \u2013 post, 1 and 3 month contrasts. A 60% reduction in pain intensity scores was observed in pre and post measures. SF-36: The physical health subcategories improved in 4 out of 5 subcategories. Similarly the mental health subcategories demonstrated change in the anticipated direction on 3 out of 5 subcategories, with 2 significant changes being observed in 2 out of the 3 subcategories. The SF-36 total component scores (combined physical and mental health sub-scales) increased between the pre intervention median (Mdn=45) to the immediate 8-week post-intervention follow-up (Mdn=67.5) (difference in Mdn 22.5-points; z=-1.99, p=.046, r=-.63). Improvement in pre and post intervention medians was maintained at 1-month (Mdn=60, z=1.57, p=.116, r=-.52) and 2- months (Mdn=53, z=1.60, p=.109, r=-.66). A significant difference was observed between the pre and 3-month comparison (Mdn=68.5, z=-2.19, p=.028, r=-.70). There was no substantial change in the chronic pain acceptance or resilience scores between pre-intervention and all post-intervention time points. Conclusion: The findings of this study indicate that the mindfulness based stress reduction program has potential health benefits on a mixed chronic pain population. Moderate to large effect sizes were observed on the health related quality of life, and large effect sizes were observed on the perceived pain levels in this mixed cohort of people experiencing chronic pain. The beneficial effects were maintained at 3-month follow up for the majority of participants in both quality of life and pain. No change in acceptance and resilience was detected. Further research in a specific New Zealand health care environment should be undertaken, due to the unique differences in the prevalence and management of chronic pain in different cultures and health care models.",

      "abstract": "Purpose This paper provides a review of the evidence regarding the economic evaluation of family therapy and family-based therapies when delivered to children and adolescents. Methods Eight databases were searched for published studies and grey literature. We included studies where both costs and effectiveness were evaluated. Due to the substantial differences in interventions, setting, disease area, and sample, we conducted a narrative summary. Results Sixteen studies were included in the review. Most studies undertook a cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA; n = 14) and among those, 1 study additionally carried out a cost-utility analysis. Four studies evaluated the cost-benefit analysis (CBA) of family based intervention, two studies only carried out a CBA while the 2 other studies included both CBA and CEA. The review showed the broad types of family-based interventions and the range of psychological disorders and addictions for which they can be used. Family-based interventions focusing on children and adolescents\u2019 health disorders were found to be cost beneficial for all the studies that used CBA, and to be cost effective in two-thirds of the studies that used CEA. Conclusions Recommendations resulting from the review are that future research should include health care costs beyond costs to the health care sector related to delivering the therapy and the spillover effects to the rest of the family, and should consider cost and effectiveness over a longer time horizon.",

      "abstract": "The stressors associated with the law enforcement profession have become a focal point of discussion as the reporting of police misconduct has been increasing. Simultaneously researchers are exploring the relationship between police stress, as manifested through physical behavior, and health outcomes. While the current definitions and theories shed some light on the pathways of police stress leading to police misconduct, the emergence of more critical, interdisciplinary theories is essential and needed so as to better understand its underlying causes scientifically and practically. Relevant studies conducted from year 2008 to present were searched and collected, through a number of databases, to investigate the relationship between stress and police misconduct. The results of the final sample of ten studies were utilized to refine a conceptual model that serves as a guiding framework to more accurately provide a conceptual picture of police stress-exposure and the role of the bio-psycho-social and environmental contributors that impact the police work environment, thereby influencing the stress experienced by police officers that lead to police misconduct. We use the Epidemiological Criminology framework to understand the biobehavioural impact of stressful exposure on health and wellness of law enforcement officers. This framework intends to help the law enforcement, research, policy, and practice community to understand more effectively the bio-psycho-social and environmental health effects within the context of the behavioural and biomedical disparities of police officers, who are likely to experience high levels of stress while on duty\u2014leading to the development of stress-reduction interventions for police officers.",

      "abstract": "Objective To evaluate the feasibility of a mobile health-supported intervention in patients with cardiovascular diseases after completion of a cardiac rehabilitation programme. Methods The feasibility study was performed in two hospitals and one municipality in Region Zealand, Denmark. Eligible participants were \u226518 years old, participated in a supervised cardiac rehabilitation programme, had access to a mobile phone, and could walk 3 m independently. Participants received a 12-week intervention utilizing behaviour change techniques, consisting of action planning, text messages, and phone support. Feasibility was assessed using pre-defined progression criteria, which included recruitment (\u226575%), retention (\u226580%), accelerometer data completeness (\u226580%), coordinator (phone support) time (\u226430 min), the response rate on patient-reported outcomes (\u226590%), adherence (\u226575% respond to \u226575% of messages), and acceptability (\u226575%). The secondary outcome of objective physical activity was assessed with accelerometers. Results Ten women and 30 men with cardiovascular diseases aged 63.5 (\u00b19.8 SD) participated. The progression criteria for retention (90%), accelerometer data completeness (83%), coordinator time (9.9 min), adherence (83%), and acceptability (82%) were at acceptable levels, exceptions were progression criteria for recruitment (35%) being below acceptable levels for recruitment, and response rate on patient-reported outcomes (75%). High satisfaction (92.6%) with the intervention was found. All objectively measured physical activity levels remained unchanged from baseline to follow-up. No serious adverse events related to the intervention were reported. Conclusion Mobile health-supported maintenance of physical activity after cardiac rehabilitation completion was feasible, safe, and acceptable. Yet, changes to improve recruitment and response rate are needed before conducting a large-scale effect evaluation.",

      "abstract": "For about 15 years, we have been attempting to create a software system (EvoFIT) that produces an identifiable composite when constructed of an unfamiliar face after a long retention interval (as is the usual case in police investigations). EvoFIT has now been shown to be effective in police field trials and has been used in 20 police forces. More recently, some developments have been very effective on their own to improve composite quality\u2014these include: (a) encouraging constructors to focus on the overall (global) properties of the face during the initial interview (Holistic CI, H-CI), (b) constructing internal features first (masking external features), and (c) presenting composites for naming using a perceptual image-stretch format. In the current project, we explored whether these techniques would produce even more identifiable composites when combined. Forty participants looked at a video of an unfamiliar target face and, 24 hours later, received an interview to obtain a description of the face (either CI/ H-CI) and then constructed a composite using EvoFIT (either blurry externals/internals-only). Further participants were presented with the resulting composites to name, first front-on (the usual way to view the face) and then by looking at the face sideways (perceptual stretch). The three techniques were effective independently, replicating past research, but together produced composites with an effect that was more than just additive\u2014to yield a mean naming level of 74% correct. A composite system using all three of these techniques would therefore appear to be effective for police-work.",

      "abstract": "In daily life, both acoustic factors and social context can affect listening effort investment. In laboratory settings, information about listening effort has been deduced from pupil and cardiovascular responses independently. The extent to which these measures can jointly predict listening-related factors is unknown. Here we combined pupil and cardiovascular features to predict acoustic and contextual aspects of speech perception. Data were collected from 29 adults (mean = 64.6 years, SD = 9.2) with hearing loss. Participants performed a speech perception task at two individualized signal-to-noise ratios (corresponding to 50% and 80% of sentences correct) and in two social contexts (the presence and absence of two observers). Seven features were extracted per trial: baseline pupil size, peak pupil dilation, mean pupil dilation, interbeat interval, blood volume pulse amplitude, pre-ejection period and pulse arrival time. These features were used to train k-nearest neighbor classifiers to predict task demand, social context and sentence accuracy. The k-fold cross validation on the group-level data revealed above-chance classification accuracies: task demand, 64.4%; social context, 78.3%; and sentence accuracy, 55.1%. However, classification accuracies diminished when the classifiers were trained and tested on data from different participants. Individually trained classifiers (one per participant) performed better than group-level classifiers: 71.7% (SD = 10.2) for task demand, 88.0% (SD = 7.5) for social context, and 60.0% (SD = 13.1) for sentence accuracy. We demonstrated that classifiers trained on group-level physiological data to predict aspects of speech perception generalized poorly to novel participants. Individually calibrated classifiers hold more promise for future applications.",

This has promoted actuarial, group-based ideas of risk assessment in relation to criminal justice. Different paradigms for justice, such as restorative justice, offer different ideas and possibilities about risk and how risk may be mitigated and managed, which may be used to reflect back on current criminal justice processes and theoretical views. Stemming from research into experienced facilitators\u2019 risk assessment and mitigation in restorative justice, the article argues that risk assessment in restorative justice incorporates a different paradigm, which is more individualistic, co-produced and strength-based. It fits the core purposes of restorative justice and the emphasis that people can change. Could it potentially be used to inform risk assessment in criminal justice? Our article considers the potential of restorative approaches to risk for criminal justice.",

      "abstract": "The objective of this study was to determine the frequency of atypical clinical and electrographic features in children with benign rolandic epilepsy. A retrospective case series design was employed in the setting of a tertiary care pediatric hospital. Forty-two children with benign rolandic epilepsy were seen through our neurology department between January 1, 1991, and December 31, 1993. Their charts were reviewed for atypical clinical features, imaging studies and results, total number of seizures at initial presentation and last follow-up, and use of anticonvulsants. Atypical clinical features included status epilepticus, developmental delay, daytime-only seizures, screaming as a seizure component, and postictal Todd's paresis. All children had at least one electroencephalogram, and these records were reviewed for atypical electrographic features such as unusual location, atypical spike morphology, and abnormal background. Atypical clinical features were seen in 50% of patients and atypical electrographic features in 31%. Computed tomographic scans were performed in 15 patients and were consistently normal. Treatment with anticonvulsant medication was initiated in 40%. Although patients with atypical features did not have an increased seizure frequency, they were more likely to undergo imaging studies (P < .01) and to be commenced on anticonvulsant medication (P < .02). Our experience suggests that atypical clinical and electrographic features are the rule rather than the exception in benign rolandic epilepsy. Further work must be done to develop a reliable definition of this common entity.",

      "abstract": "We used explorative interviews to gauge (inter)personal, physiological, and emotional challenges of seven rural cancer patients who traveled long distances to cancer treatment centers. After a thematic analysis, we foregrounded experiences of temporality by using a phenomenologically inspired approach. The analysis resulted in three themes: (a) An epiphany of \"what really matters in life\"-time gains new meaning, (b) Feeling out of sync with others and own body-striving for coherence and simultaneity, and (c) Being torn between benefits of home and treatments site-time and distance as a tangible aspect of traveling and being away. Under these themes, 13 meaning units were generated, which reflected changes in temporality. During treatment, life primarily revolved around repeating circles of travel arrangements, staying on top of treatment schedule, and synchronizing a home life with a life away from home. Nurses should provide comprehensive care to enhance stability in cancer patients' temporal experiences.",

If this assumption is false\u2014or even if the quality of survey participants\u2019 responses change because of measurement\u2014then social scientists risk mischaracterizing the existence, magnitude, and correlates of changes across survey waves in respondents\u2019 characteristics. In this article, we make the case that social scientists ought to worry more about panel conditioning biases. We also describe and demonstrate empirical strategies for estimating the magnitude of such biases in longitudinal surveys, and we provide illustrative empirical results that are germane to social science research. We end by outlining a research agenda that would generate specific information about the nature and degree of panel conditioning in specific longitudinal surveys as well as a broader understanding of the circumstances in which panel conditioning is most likely to occur.",

      "abstract": "We illustrate how standard psychometric inventories originally designed for assessing noncognitive human traits can be repurposed as diagnostic tools to evaluate analogous traits in large language models (LLMs). We start from the assumption that LLMs, inadvertently yet inevitably, acquire psychological traits (metaphorically speaking) from the vast text corpora on which they are trained. Such corpora contain sediments of the personalities, values, beliefs, and biases of the countless human authors of these texts, which LLMs learn through a complex training process. The traits that LLMs acquire in such a way can potentially influence their behavior, that is, their outputs in downstream tasks and applications in which they are employed, which in turn may have real-world consequences for individuals and social groups. By eliciting LLMs\u2019 responses to language-based psychometric inventories, we can bring their traits to light. Psychometric profiling enables researchers to study and compare LLMs in terms of noncognitive characteristics, thereby providing a window into the personalities, values, beliefs, and biases these models exhibit (or mimic). We discuss the history of similar ideas and outline possible psychometric approaches for LLMs. We demonstrate one promising approach, zero-shot classification, for several LLMs and psychometric inventories. We conclude by highlighting open challenges and future avenues of research for AI Psychometrics.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a frequent complication of interstitial lung disease (ILD). Although PH has mostly been described in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, it can manifest in association with many other forms of ILD. Associated pathogenetic mechanisms are complex and incompletely understood but there is evidence of disruption of molecular and genetic pathways, with panvascular histopathologic changes, multiple pathophysiologic sequelae, and profound clinical ramifications. While there are some recognized clinical phenotypes such as combined pulmonary fibrosis and emphysema and some possible phenotypes such as connective tissue disease associated with ILD and PH, the identification of further phenotypes of PH in ILD has thus far proven elusive. This statement reviews the current evidence on the pathogenesis, recognized patterns, and useful diagnostic tools to detect phenotypes of PH in ILD. Distinct phenotypes warrant recognition if they are characterized through either a distinct presentation, clinical course, or treatment response. Furthermore, we propose a set of recommendations for future studies that might enable the recognition of new phenotypes.",

In the financial sector, for example, algorithms are used in credit scoring, money has become transactional data sought after by large data-driven companies, while financial technologies (FinTech) are emerging as a locus of information warfare. To grasp the context specificity of algorithmic governance and the assumptions on which its evaluation within different domains is based, we comparatively study the sociotechnical imaginaries of algorithmic governance in European Union (EU) policy on online disinformation and FinTech. We find that sociotechnical imaginaries prevalent in EU policy documents on disinformation and FinTech are highly divergent. While the first can be characterized as an algorithm-facilitated attempt to return to the presupposed status quo (absence of manipulation) without a defined future imaginary, the latter places technological innovation at the centre of realizing a globally competitive Digital Single Market.",

Despite this potential, research analysing such data often struggles to construct novel theoretical insight. This paper argues that holistically incorporating temporality enhances data collection and data analysis, subsequently facilitating process theory construction from SMTD. Recommendations to integrate temporality are outlined in the proposed Temporal Dynamics Framework and Methodology (TDFM). We apply the TDFM to investigate the temporal dynamics of mental health discourse on Twitter (now X) across different phases of the COVID-19 pandemic, theoretically framed in the context of innate psychological needs satisfaction. The findings reveal dynamic shifts in social media use, indicating that different phases of the pandemic triggered changes in the needs motivating, and being motivated by, social media use. This illustrative case reflectively evaluates the TDFM's usefulness in contextualising SMTD collection, analytical strategies, and process theory construction by incorporating a dynamic perspective on time.",

Current guidelines propose initiation and escalation of PAH\u2010targeted treatment based on a goal\u2010directed approach targeting hemodynamic, functional, and biochemical variables. This approach has been successfully validated in large Caucasian cohorts. However, given the low number of Hispanic patients enrolled in large PAH trials and registries, it is unknown if the same prognostic tools can be applied to this patient population. We analyzed a single\u2010center outpatient cohort that consisted of 135 Hispanic patients diagnosed with PAH. Baseline characteristics were calculated based on COMPERA, COMPERA 2.0 and REVEAL 2.0 risk scores before the initiation of PAH\u2010targeted therapies. The survival rate at 1 year after diagnosis was 88% for the entire cohort. The three established risk scores to predict PAH outcomes yielded similar results with reasonable discrimination of mortality in the different risk strata (all p &lt; 0.001). Hispanic patients with PAH have a high mortality rate. Our analysis suggests that guideline proposed risk assessment at baseline yields important prognostic information in this patient population.",
